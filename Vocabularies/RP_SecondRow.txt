Hey now, the second row is my fallback row!
Dammit
Not bad clearing out some edges form the second row
Come on now, I'm trying to keep these edges in double digits %Lol%
Next time try for the third row or lower %EmoteFlustered%
Nooooo I like the second row %EmoteFlustered%
Next time try for a lower number %Lol%
That was high enough that I still didn't want to lose it %EmoteFlustered%
Not bad you lucky bastard %Lol%
Awww I kinda wanted that one
Sucks to see that one go %EmoteFlustered%
Come on, leave the second row alone %Lol%
Noo that's from my fallback row
Awwww damn
Oh well, you win some you lose some
Damn I would have liked to keep that one
I wanted that one to stick around %EmoteFlustered%
Could have done better, but still pretty lucky
Booo
I want a redo please %EmoteFlustered%
Just try to pick out edges from the bottom two rows in the future %Lol%
Awww can I have that one back?
At least it wasn't from the top row %EmoteFlustered%
Lucky fucker %Lol%
