There you go, knock out some of those lower ones %EmoteHappy%
Careful you don't knock out too many of those %Lol%
At least it wasn't from the first row %Lol%
That's it %SubName%, stay nice and low %Grin%
Ooh, that's gotta sting a little
I'm starting to think you WANT to give me a lot of edges %Grin%
Not a bad pick %EmoteHappy%
I like it when you take out the lower ones %EmoteHappy%
Good, get that one out of there %Lol%
You didn't want that one anyway %Lol%
Tough break, gotta watch those low ones %Grin%
Not making things very easy on yourself %Grin%
Say goodbye to that one %EmoteHappy%
Keep picking like that and I'll be happy %Grin%
Good %Lol%
I'm happy with that pick %EmoteHappy%
Good job knocking out a low one %Lol%
I like watching the third row disappear
Gonna have to do better than that %Grin%
Hey, at least it wasn't the bottom row %EmoteHappy%
Neither of us wanted that one there %Lol%
Not the greatest play I've seen from you %Lol%
Bye bye case %Lol%
Another set of second row edges bites the dust %Grin%
