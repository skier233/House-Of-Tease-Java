You've made too many mistakes while addressing me #GeneralTime, #PetName


Keep addressing me like that and I'll just have to keep punishing you #PetName


How much longer will it take for you to learn how to address me properly?


How many times do I have to punish you before you start addressing me properly?
You're going to learn how to address me #PetName...
You know how I expect to be addressed #PetName...
I believe you meant #DomHonorific #DomName...
Allow me to show you what happens when you forget to say #DomHonorific
If you want your #Balls to survive, you better learn how to address me
That does it, I'm sick of being addressed that way
