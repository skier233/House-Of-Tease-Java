Maybe you just say that because it's a bit difficult to think right now #Grin
At least you've found a way to make yourself useful, #PetName #Smile
Your purpose is to ache and suffer for me, #Name
@GoodMood You're doing a fine job fulfilling your purpose, #PetName #Smile
@BadMood You're going to have to try harder to fulfil your purpose, #PetName
You should be grateful, not everyone finds their purpose in life #Smile
I'm sure you can think of some other purposes as well #Smile
I wouldn't say my only purpose is to make you suffer, #PetName @FollowUp(But I'm having a great time doing it anyway)
