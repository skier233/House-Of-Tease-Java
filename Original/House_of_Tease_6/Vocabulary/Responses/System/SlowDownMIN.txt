I think you're stroking slow enough
You're stroking slow enough #PetName

You're not supposed to be doing anything #PetName
What are you trying to slow down, I didn't tell you to stroke yet

[Edging]
You can go as slow as you want to reach the edge
I don't care how slow you stroke as long as you get close for me
All I care about is that you get close
Stroke as slow as you want, just get close for me
[Edging End]
[Holding The Edge]
Go as slow as you want, just make sure you stay right there on the edge
Go as slow as it takes to stay right there on the edge for me
I don't care how slow you stroke, just stay on the edge
As long as you stay right there on the edge

You want to smack that #Cock slower, be my guest
[CBT Cock End]
[CBT Balls]
You want to smack slower? Sure, give those #Balls more time to feel the ache #Lol
Nothing stopping you from giving me slower ball smacks if you want
Smack those #Balls around as slow as you want
