No #PetName, that #Cock doesn't get a warm up today #EmoteRandom
No #PetName, I want to start you off fast #GeneralTime #EmoteRandom
Nah, I'm impatient to get that #Cock suffering today #PetName #EmoteRandom
If you need to slow down already, you're #Gonna have a rough time #GeneralTime #Lol. No, keep going just like that

You want to stroke a little bit slower? No. #EmoteRandom @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
I don't think so, you keep stroking just like that @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
Not #Gonna happen #PetName, stroke just like that and suffer @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
You want to slow down? Too bad #EmoteRandom @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
Too bad #EmoteRandom  @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)

Struggling, huh? Good. Keep struggling @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
I know what I'm doing #PetName. #DoAsISay @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
I know your #Cock better than you do #PetName. #DoAsISay @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
This pace is pretty much perfect for me. Keep going #EmoteRandom @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)
The fact that you want to slow down tells me everything I need to know. It means this pace is perfect, and I'm #Gonna keep you right there #EmoteRandom @SetDate(AV_AskedSlow,0 seconds)

[Stroking End]
[Not Stroking]
You're not supposed to be doing anything #PetName
What are you trying to slow, I didn't tell you to stroke yet
Say what? Do I even want to know what you're doing over there #Lol
[Not Stroking End]
[Edging]
Don't slow down, I want you to that edge as quick as possible
I don't care how slow you stroke as long as you get close for me
All I care about is that you get close
Stroke as slow as you want, just get close for me
[Edging End]
[Holding The Edge]
No, don't slow down. Tough it out and ride that edge for me
Don't you dare slow down, and don't you dare cross that edge
You're not #Gonna slow down, and you're damn sure not #Gonna cross that edge
I don't think so, you're #Gonna suffer the edge at that exact speed
[Holding The Edge End]
[CBT Cock]
But I have so many cock smacks to get through #GeneralTime #EmoteRandom
But I like the thought of that #Cock bouncing around with rapid fire smacks #EmoteRandom
Don't slow down your smacks, I want to think about that #Cock bouncing around #EmoteRandom
[CBT Cock End]
[CBT Balls]
I don't want to slow down these smacks, I want those balls to suffer #EmoteRandom
But I'm having so much fun treating those #Balls like paddle balls #EmoteRandom
I'll smack those #Balls around as fast as I want
[CBT Balls End]
[After Tease]
We're done for now #PetName
