[not addicted to you,re not my addiction]
[All]
Sooner or later you'll have to admit it, you <i>are</i> addicted to my control
Don't deny it, #PetName
Don't worry, it's a good kind of addiction #Smile
Yeah right #Laugh
You're not fooling anyone, #Name #Laugh
Keep telling yourself that, #Name #Smile
[All End]
