@GoodMood You've already been such a good boy for me so far #Smile
@GoodMood You're so eager to please me today, I love it #EmoteHappy
@BadMood If you mean that you're going to have to try a lot harder from now on
@BadMood Oh really? You haven't been all that good so far, #PetName
@BadMood So you'll do anything I want from now on, right? @ResponseYes(I Will Do Anything) @ResponseNo(I Will Do Anything Not)
@NeutralMood I guess we'll see what those words mean exactly...
@NeutralMood That sounds promising #Smile
@NeutralMood Do realise you're raising some pretty big expectations by saying that...
@NeutralMood I expect nothing less from you, #PetName
@NeutralMood Make sure you keep a promise when you make one, #SubName #Smile
@NeutralMood Does that mean you'll do anything I tell you to? @ResponseYes(I Will Do Anything) @ResponseNo(I Will Do Anything Not)
[All End]
[First Round]
@NeutralMood Maybe if you're a good boy I won't be so cruel to you #GeneralTime
