[Before Tease]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Very funny #PetName, we haven't even started yet!
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Maybe later, when you've actually done some stroking
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) We've only just started #Name
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) I don't see why, we haven't even started yet
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Maybe ask me again when your #Balls are a darker shade of blue #Grin
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) It's to early to start asking for a break #Name
[Before Tease End]
[First Round]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) You already need a break!? I don't think so
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Nah, you're not desperate enough #Smile
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Better keep that break for when you <i>really</i> need it
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) We've only just begun #Name
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Maybe later, if you ask nicely #Smile
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) Hmm... I don't think so #Name
[First Round End]
[Stroking]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) I guess you can take a little break now @CallReturn(Custom\CallReturn\pvCr_BreakStroking.txt)
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) All this edging is getting to you isn't it? #Grin @CallReturn(Custom\CallReturn\pvCr_BreakEdging.txt)
[Stroking End]
[Not Stroking]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) You're not stroking, in my book that counts as a break
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) You could quit and come back later, but I doubt that's what you really want
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) There's no point #Name, you're not even stroking!
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) All this edging is getting to you isn't it? #Grin @CallReturn(Custom\CallReturn\pvCr_BreakEdging.txt)
[Not Stroking End]
[Edging]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Maybe after you hit this edge
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Just edge for me #Name
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Get to the edge #Name
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) Nope. Try asking me again after you hit the edge #Smile
[Edging End]
[Holding The Edge]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) No, stay right there on the edge #Name
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) I don't think you need one
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) No break, keep edging
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) Just hold it a little longer #Name
[Holding The Edge End]
[CBT Cock]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) #OhNo
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) No way #PetName
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Not gonna happen
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) #OhNo
[CBT Cock End]
[CBT Balls]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) #OhNo
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) No way #PetName
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) Not gonna happen
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) #OhNo
[CBT Balls End]
[Chastity]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) You could just walk away #Name, but I doubt that's what you want #Grin
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) You could just walk away #Name, but I doubt that's what you want #Grin
[Chastity End]
[After Tease]
@Flag(pthevBreakNormal) We're done for today #Name
@Flag(pthevBreakEdging) We're done for today #Name
