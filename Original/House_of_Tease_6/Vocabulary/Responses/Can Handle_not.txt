[First Round]
But we're only getting started #PetName #EmoteRandom
It's <i>way</i> too early to start talking like that #PetName #EmoteRandom
You better find a way, we have a <i>long</i> way to go yet #EmoteRandom
[First Round End]
[Stroking]
Really? Cause I was kinda going easy on you #EmoteRandom
But knowing you can't handle it is what makes it so much fun for me #EmoteRandom
Trust me #PetName, you're nowhere near your limits yet
Too bad #PetName, there's no mercy for you here #EmoteRandom
Awww if only I had any sympathy for you and that #Cock
Too bad, you'll just have to keep stroking anyway
I bet I can make you handle even way more than you think you can #EmoteRandom
I know what I'm doing #PetName. #DoAsISay
I know your #Cock better than you do #PetName. #DoAsISay
You have no idea what your own limits are #PetName. #DoAsISay
#Imagine me stroking your #Cock for you. Does that make it any easier?
#Imagine me tying you down and doing all the work on your #Cock myself. That should make it easier #Grin

[Edging]
Good to know #Grin
Your #Cock will feel what I want it to feel whether you can handle it or not
If you're struggling now, just wait until you actually reach the edge #EmoteRandom
You can do this #PetName. I know you can #Grin
#Imagine me right there with you, forcing you to the edge. That should make it easier to accept that you're not in control #Grin
[Edging End]
[Holding The Edge]
Sure you can take this #PetName. Just don't think about how close you are right now #EmoteRandom
I don't <i>want</i> you to be able to handle being this close #EmoteRandom
You better fight it. I don't want you anywhere else but right on the edge
You can handle this. And you will, because I told you to
It's #Hot to hear you say that, #PetName. Keep edging
Perfect! That's exactly what I want #EmoteHappy Keep going
Don't worry, we haven't hit your true limit yet #Grin Keep going
Hearing you say that... pretty much my favorite part #Grin
Sure you can take this #PetName. #Imagine me right there with you, forcing you to stay on this edge. That should make it easier to accept that you're not in control #Grin
[Holding The Edge End]
[CBT Cock]
I think your cock can take more for me #EmoteRandom
I'm willing to bet that #Cock is more resilient than you give it credit for #EmoteRandom
[CBT Cock End]
[CBT Balls]
Actually you'd be surprised just how much those balls <i>can</i> take #EmoteRandom
I know your balls can't take it, that's why it's so much fun abusing them #EmoteRandom
[CBT Balls End]
[After Tease]
You'll handle it for me #SubName
Just promise me you'll be good until we play again #EmoteRandom
Stay strong for me #PetName
