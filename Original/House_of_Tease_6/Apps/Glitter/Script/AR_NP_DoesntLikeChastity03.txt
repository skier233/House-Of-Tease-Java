My sub seems to dislike being kept in a #ChastityCage #EmoteSad
@Contact3 I told you 100 times that you shouldn't allow him to complain. He wears a #ChastityCage and that is that.
@Contact1 That's why I prefer <i>slaves</i>, rather than <i>subs</i>. Slaves are not allowed to complain.
@Contact2 Give him some time to get used to it, but tell him that you do want it.
@Contact1 No slave likes to be caged. A #ChastityCage is not supposed to be to wear #EmoteRandom
