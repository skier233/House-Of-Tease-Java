What do you think the sexiest part of the female body is?
I have a flat stomach, I love that I have a flat stomach lol
My collar and my neck, I love getting kissed there too
If I'm being kissed, my lips and my tongue can be all kinds of sexy 
Never underestimate how sensual your feet can be
My eyes, most of the time, I feel like I could tear a man down with them
My hands, I can make anything sexier with my hands (:
@Custom1 I don't know, there's a lot about me that I don't like, #SubName does a pretty good job of making me feel good about myself though. If I had to choose, probably my hair
@Custom1 I really like the way my rear end looks, no shame on the dance floor!
@Custom1 I'm pretty proud of my breasts, I must admit though, sometimes I think they might<i>almost</i> be to big
@Custom2 Mmmm, guys always go for cleavage, personally... i think my legs are my favourite
@Custom2 I think my legs, I'm always wearing mini skirts to show them off
