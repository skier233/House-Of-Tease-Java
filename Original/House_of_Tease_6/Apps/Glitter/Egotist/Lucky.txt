#SubName really has been a good little #PetName #GeneralTime. Mmm, I'm going to need some alone time after this *grins wickedly* 
@Contact1 When do I get to #PlayWith him, #ShortName? You owe me!! #EmotePout
@Contact2 I sure hope you #RewardHim #ShortName. He deserves it!
@Contact3 You indulge your "#PetName" far too often... I'm starting to think you actually care for him #EmoteDisapprove
