I still don't understand why it's so fun to see #SubName's frustration...
@Contact1 Don't think and just enjoy! #EmoteLaugh
@Contact1 If you didn't have fun, would you tease him?
@Contact2 He loves you so much that he is ready to endure a lot for you #EmoteRandom
@Contact2 It's sweet torture that #SubName accepts knowing that you'll enjoy it!
@Contact3 Because it's pleasant to see someone accepting to suffer for you #EmoteRandom
@Contact3 It's fun to see him ask for it and then regret it! #EmoteLaugh
@Contact3 After some time, you need to become meaner and meaner so you can still enjoy it #EmoteLaugh
