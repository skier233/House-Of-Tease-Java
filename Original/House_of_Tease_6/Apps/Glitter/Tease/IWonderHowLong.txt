I wonder how long a guy can go without orgasm before he absolutely HAS to cum?
@Contact1 That sounds like a fun experiement!
@Contact1 One way to find out!
@Contact1 If you want any help finding out... I volunteer
@Contact3 I still wouldn't let him
@Contact3 Why not just keep him denied permanently and be done with it?
@Contact3 Does any guy truly HAVE to cum? I don't think so
@Contact2 Surely not more than a day or two?
@Contact2 A better question would be how long could I go before I absolutely have to MAKE him cum?
@Contact2 I still it's a waste to play with a nice cock and not let it cum when you're finished
@Contact1 What kind of question is that?! You should ALWAYS make him cum!
@Contact1 You realize you sound like a mad scientist, right?
@Contact1 What happens if he breaks something in there?
