When with #SubName, I don't know if I prefer to tell him in advance what is going to happen tonight or not to tell anything. In other words, what do you prefer: stimulating anticipation or making surprises?
@Contact1 I thought Glitter had a 140-character limit?
@Contact1 I'd go for the anticipation, and then do something he wasn't expecting.
@Contact2 Alternate between both!
@Contact2
@Contact3 Don't tell anything. He will be happy with a surprise. 
@Contact1 Don't tell anything, because you can change your mind without having him upset if you do.
