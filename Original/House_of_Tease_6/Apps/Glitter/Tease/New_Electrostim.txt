Have any of you ever seen a boy hooked up to an electrostim box?
@Glitter3 My ET312 is my best friend!
@Glitter3 You should get one, does wonders to a bad sub
@Glitter3 Ah yes, a little pleasure then a LOT of pain
@Glitter1 Intriguing!  Call me!
@Glitter1 Hmm, I hear you can milk a boy?
@Glitter1 I don't need such things, my tongue is torture enough
@Glitter2 Be careful if you get one, you can damage him
@Glitter2 Don't turn it up too high - ouchy
@Glitter2 Let him control it himself though
@Glitter1 They are expensive, you can't afford one
@Glitter1 You would probably break it
@Glitter1 There goes the electric bill...
