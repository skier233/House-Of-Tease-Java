I'm not sure about letting my sub get a Fleshlight...
@Contact1 I'm pretty sure it doesn't have boobs. Therefore, don't worry, he won't replace you with it #EmoteRandom
@Contact1 Tell him he has to tell one friend of his everytime he uses it #EmoteRandom
@Contact2 Is it even realistic enough? 
@Contact2 You can let him use it as a reward #EmoteHappy
@Contact2 Why would you want to ban light? Aw, a Fleshlight... Never mind. 
@Contact3 If he does want one, maybe you should refuse it. 
@Contact3 I heard it's really rough when you use it for post-orgasm torture.
