Has someone read "Owning and Training a Male Slave" by Ingrid Bellemare?
@Contact1 You're not the first Domme to tell me about this book... Should I read it?
@Contact2 Too harsh for me.
@Contact3 Yep. I do that to my two subs - now slaves.
@Contact3 She really does understand what "slave" means. Not only sexual, but also for all the housework. A good old-fashioned slave. Not the fantasy slave that you love and sometimes reward. An actual slave. The one from the Middle-Age, you know?
