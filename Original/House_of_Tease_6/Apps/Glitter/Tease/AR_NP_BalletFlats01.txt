What do you girls think about ballet flats? A vanilla friend of mine told me they were passion killers.
@Contact1 Did she also say "no offence intended"? #EmoteLaugh
@Contact2 The only shoes that are even more feminine than ballet flats are high heels. 
@Contact2 I don't undertsand why. Do you?
@Contact3 Did she say why?
@Contact3 Has she mentioned any reason?
@Contact1 That's true. Why do you wear these shoes? #EmoteRandom
