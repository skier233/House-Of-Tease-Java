I love #SubName so much I want to tease him at every second of every day!
@Contact1 I can assure you he will love you in return #EmoteRandom
@Contact1 You don't need to go that far. Just tease him until he cries, then continue for one hour or so. 
@Contact2 Don't forget you need to sleep and eat sometimes #EmoteLaugh
@Contact2 That's so cute! #EmoteRandom
@Contact3 Maybe I don't love my subs... I always want <i>them</i> to please me at every second of every day. #EmoteFrowny
