Have you heard of volcanic lightnings? Sometimes a lightning appears in the plume of a volcano #EmoteSurprised
@Contact1 Is this how you call it when #SubName cums when you're furious? #LOL
@Contact2 Yes, I have. I've visited hell once. #EmoteRandom
@Contact2 Is it how you imagine hell?
@Contact2 It should be awful to see. Or beautiful. But definitely scary.
@Contact3 Are you trying to justify a Pok√©mon of types fire/electricity?
@Contact3 It sounds like me. I strike a man like lightning and we end up in a bed as hot as a volcano.
