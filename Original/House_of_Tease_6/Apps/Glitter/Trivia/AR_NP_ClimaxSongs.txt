I don't like it when the climax of a song isn't at the end of the song.
@Contact1 I agree with you. The rest sounds boring after that.
@Contact1 It sounds like a dramatic experience. Please tell us everything.
@Contact2 Because the climax is so great that you want to restart the song just for it, but you feel you lack something because the song is not over yet.
@Contact3 I can relate. 
@Contact3 What songs are you refering to? #EmoteRandom
