#Contact1, have you had time to read the book I gave you?
@Contact1 I read a few pages in the bus this morning! It's great #EmoteHappy
@Contact1 Not yet! I have it in my handbag.
@Contact2 Which book?
@Contact2 Why don't you offer me books, #ShortName?
@Contact3 #Contact1 can read? I'm learning everyday! #EmoteLaugh
