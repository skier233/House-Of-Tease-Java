The fingerprints of koala bears are virtually indistinguishable from those of humans, so much so that they could be confused at a crime scene 
What if they were secretly criminal masterminds, and wanted us to think they are being confused at crime scenes?
Koalas, so sweet yet so naughty
I love koalas!
