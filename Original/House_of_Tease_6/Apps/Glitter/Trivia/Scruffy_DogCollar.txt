Spiked dog collars were invented in Ancient Greece to protect dogs throats from wolves
And now they are used for naughty slaves
I wonder if you could turn one inside out and wrap it around #SubName's balls
You should make #SubName wear one
My old dog had one of those!
I don't like how they look on dogs
Really?
