Do toes have names?
@Contact1 I don't know for yours but mine do #EmoteLaugh
@Contact1 Yes they do. But I don't know the names. #EmoteLaugh
@Contact2 The fact is, we don't need to name them. I don't usually use one toe at a time.
@Contact3 You would know if you were a doctor.
@Contact3 Probably latin names.
