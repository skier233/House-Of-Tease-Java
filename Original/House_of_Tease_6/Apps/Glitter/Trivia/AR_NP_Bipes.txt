There exist a lizard with two arms and no legs!
@Contact1 And it has a strange name... "Bipes" #EmoteRandom
@Contact2 I googled "lizard with two arms and no legs" and found an article about legless lizards... I thought the main difference between lizards and snakes was the legs!
@Contact3 Admit it, you spend most of your time watching biology documentaries! #EmoteLaugh
