What would you do with more than $5000 a month?
@Contact1 I think I'd eat at the restaurant every single day.
@Contact1 I would travel around the world!
@Contact1 If you have no idea what to do with so much money, just give it to the friend that put you up during college #EmoteWrink
@Contact2 I would buy a beautiful, $3000 dress every month! #LOL
@Contact2 #ShortName, have you won to the lottery?
@Contact2 I've already thought about that. I like my life the way it is, I think that I wouldn't change much with $5000 a month.
@Contact2 I would donate to every charity that puts people in front of metro station entrances. 
@Contact3 I would properly feed my slaves #LOL
@Contact3 $5000? You can't do much with so little money #LOL
