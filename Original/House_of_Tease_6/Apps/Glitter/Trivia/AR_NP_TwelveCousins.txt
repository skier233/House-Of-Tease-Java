I discovered I had at least twelve cousins that I've never heard about until now #EmoteSurprised
@Contact1 #ShortName discovers she is not the only one in her family.
@Contact1 I'm sure it's the same for me!
@Contact1 I think you have a sister too. And parents.
@Contact2 Better late than never! #LOL
@Contact2 I know a few of my cousins and haven't talked to the rest of them...
@Contact3 Spoiler alert: you also have uncles and aunts #LOL
@Contact3 Twelve? How is it possible? Have you found the secret way to escape from family dinners?
