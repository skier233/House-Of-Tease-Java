Why do we even put onions in food?
@Contact1 Uh-oh! #ShortName is crying #EmoteLaugh
@Contact2 This is a good question #EmoteSurprised
@Contact2 Do we even need them? What did onions bring to society?
@Contact3 I heard it's because it serves as a base for the other flavours.
@Contact3 Let me search for an answer. It's something I have wondered a lot.
