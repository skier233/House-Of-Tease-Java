Are there were-giraffes? Were-whales?
@Contact1 Aren't werewolves and werebears enough for you?
@Contact1 Were-giraffes are called "tall people". 
@Contact1 Were-whales are called "fat people". 
@Contact2 The thought of were-giraffes is really funny though!
@Contact3 What about were-humans? Half human, half... human... #LOL
