A friend told me that it's impossible to invent a new colour. I don't know what to think about that.
@Contact1 Was your friend depressed or something?
@Contact1 Now that #ShortName knows it's impossible, she won't be able to do it! #LOL
@Contact2 It depends on how subtle the shades are, I guess...
@Contact3 It's because slight variations of a colour are still called the same way.
