I've just noticed... The English alphabet doesn't fit its words... I mean, how do you know how to pronounce a word by only spelling it?
@Contact1 You don't. You need to hear people speaking and remember how each word pronounces.
@Contact2 You have just found the reason why Spanish, French and Italian-speaking people have a hard time learning English!
@Contact3 Sure, English is not easy to learn for people who rely on the spelling of the words!
@Contact3 Who cares? English almost doesn't have any grammar and conjugation.
