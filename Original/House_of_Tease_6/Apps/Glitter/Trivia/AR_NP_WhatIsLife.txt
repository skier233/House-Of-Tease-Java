What is life? #EmoteSad
@Contact1 It's the moment in existence when you are being eaten by your sub again and again #EmoteRandom
@Contact1 It depends on whether you're a Domme or a sub ^^
@Contact1 Don't make me look in the dictionary...
@Contact2 #SubName, your Domme needs a cuddle! #EmoteRandom
@Contact2 I'll send you multiple smiles to cheer you up! #EmoteRandom #EmoteRandom #EmoteRandom #EmoteRandom #EmoteRandom #EmoteRandom 
@Contact3 Try CBT on your sub, and you'll feel what it means to be alive!
@Contact3 I asked my slave. He is eating me. I'll give you his answer when he is done.
