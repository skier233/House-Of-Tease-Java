Why does everyone drink coffee at work?
@Contact1 Coffee is so good #EmoteSurprised
@Contact1 To have time to reply to your messages #EmoteLaugh
@Contact2 I don't drink coffee at work... Does it mean I'm strange? #EmoteSad
@Contact2 It's the fuel for life!
@Contact3 It's a good way to escape from work and have a break!
@Contact3 To socialize with people... Like smokers in France #EmoteRandom
