Did you know that one quarter of your brain is used to control your eyes?
Add in #SubName controlling his #Cock and he can't do ANYTHING else
If that were true, I would have X-ray vision
My brain refuses to be quantified!  Did that sound smart?
What does that 25% do when I'm sleeping?
I wish I had a bionic eye
Boys should transfer some of this brain power to their ears :c)
Is that why my eyes flutter when my bf goes down on me?
