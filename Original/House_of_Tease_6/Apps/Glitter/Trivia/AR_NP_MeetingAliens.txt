What would you do if you met an alien?
@Contact1 You mean a stranger? Well, if they speak English, you can just say "hello", I guess.
@Contact1 I would call you and observe your reaction #EmoteRandom
@Contact2 I think I would try to attack them all... Or cry, I'm not sure.
@Contact2 Cry... Or run... Or running in tears...
@Contact3 Have I really read this question?
