I like French poetry but I don't understand a word.
@Contact1 I like reading the ancient Egyptian texts but I don't know any of their hieroglyphs. 
@Contact2 I won't try to understand what you mean.
@Contact3 Baudelaire, Apollinaire, Paul Val√©ry, Victor Hugo... Wait, you read them but don't understand?
