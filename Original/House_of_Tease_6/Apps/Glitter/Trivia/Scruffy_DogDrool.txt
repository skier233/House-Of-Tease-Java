An average large dog dribbles 1.5 litres of water per year.
Ew that's disgusting #ShortName
Sounds about right, my dog used to dribble [i]everywhere[i/]
I'm sure #SubName dribbles a lot more when he is extra horny!
That's about the same amount of precum #SubName produces after a session with #ShortName right?
#ShortName!
How did they even measure that!?
