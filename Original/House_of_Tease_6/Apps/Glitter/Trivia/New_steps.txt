In one day, an average person will take about 18,000 steps
Whatever, my phone says I never break 5,000 :(
Wow, that is quite a workout
Maybe if you walk 4 miles to work, uphill, and barefoot
Hmm, guess I'll go eat a candy bar
My FitBit can't even count that high!
What if you had to take all of them going backward
I am NOT average, apparently...
