Somebody teach me the piano!
@Contact1 Does someone play the piano there? #EmoteLaugh
@Contact1 I can. First lesson. You have fingers. You can type the keys of the piano with them. Next lesson, next week. Don't forget to keep practising.
@Contact2 Maybe you need a piano beforehand #EmoteLaugh
@Contact2 Don't do that! Life is worth living! #EmoteLaugh
@Contact3 I think one of my slaves can teach you some basics. But I'm not sure he remembers much #EmoteLaugh
