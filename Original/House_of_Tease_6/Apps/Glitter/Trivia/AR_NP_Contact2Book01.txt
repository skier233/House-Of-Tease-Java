#Contact2, I found the book you left at my home!
@Contact1 Ah! <i>You</i> had it! I wanted to steal it from #Contact2 but I couldn't find it!
@Contact1 I wanted to steal it from #Contact2 but I went in the wrong house!
@Contact1 Finally #Contact2 will be able to give it back to me!
@Contact2 Thanks, I was planning to buy a new one!
@Contact2 Just before I go buy a new one! Thanks!
@Contact3 Which book? The one with a precious ring? 
@Contact3 Does #Contact2 even read? #LOL
