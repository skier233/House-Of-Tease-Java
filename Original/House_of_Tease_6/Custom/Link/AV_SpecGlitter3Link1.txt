#DomName have been complaining. You don't really follow their instructions, do you? @SetModule(AV_SpecGlitter3Module1)
You just ignore their punishments as you please, is that true?
[yes] Great! I will give you a lesson that you cannot skip... 
[no] No, you have never skipped a punishment before? Then you wouldn't have any problems with my new, unskippable punishment...
@DifferentAnswer #YesorNo #SubName?
