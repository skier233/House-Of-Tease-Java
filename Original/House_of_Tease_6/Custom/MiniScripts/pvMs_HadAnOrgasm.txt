What!?
Just now or earlier?
[now] Dammit, #Name
[earlier,before,between,yesterday] I'm disappointed in you, #Name @Goto(orgasm earlier)
@DifferentAnswer Just now or before our session, #Name?
Did you at least ruin it?
[yes] That's something I guess @UpdateRuined @Goto(ruined it)
[no] You should <i>always</i> ruin it when you cum without permission @UpdateOrgasm
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Since you didn't, I really don't see the point in continuing this session
Maybe next time you'll have more self control
I hope you at least enjoyed your orgasm
Bye
@EndTease
@End
(ruined it)
@Flag(av_fetish_cei) Lick it up, #Name
@Flag(av_fetish_cei) Swallow every drop of your ruined orgasm @Wait(10)
Do you want to continue?
[yes] Alright @Goto(ruined continue)
[no] Alright then
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Maybe next time you'll have more self control
Bye, #PetName

But I'm glad you told me
It shows that you know you made a mistake
Unfortunately, I can't watch you every minute of the day
So this kind of thing is bound to happen
Given the kind of chronic masturbator that you are
Unless...
You promise me it won't happen again
In which case I'll hold you to it, #SubName
So, will you give me control over when you masturbate?
[yes] Good! @SetFlag(pthevCompleteControlYES)
[no] #EmoteSad @SetFlag(pthevCompleteControlNO) @Goto(moving on no control)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Let's move on now, #Name
But remember, next time you cum without permission...
I won't be so forgiving

(Sub Stroking)
You better still be stroking, #PetName
@End
(Sub Not Stroking)
Okay, #Name
@End
(control yes)
You promised not to touch yourself without my permission @MoodDown
And you broke that promise @MoodDown @InterruptsOn
@NullResponse @TempFlag(pvPunishmentEndTease) @Interrupt(pvInt_Punishment)
@NullResponse
(control no)
But since I can't watch you every minute of the day
I guess this was bound to happen #EmoteSad
