Since you are so horny... 
I've been thinking about something #PetName  
The thing is, it would really turn me on if
You let me ruin your orgasm #Grin
Will be easier for you to continue our session after that
Will you let me do that to you?
[yes] Oh thank you, you just made me so happy #EmoteHappy @Goto(Now I'm Gonna Make You Ache)
[no] I see 
[I don't know, dunno, maybe, scared] Just think about how happy you'll make me #EmoteHappy @LoopAnswer
@DifferentAnswer C'mon #PetName, yes or no. Will you let me ruin your orgasm?
Well, I do understand that it's beyond your limits
So I don't mind giving you one of my usual tease sessions #EmoteHappy 
Either way I know you're about to ache like crazy #Grin

(Now I'm Gonna Make You Ache)
And now I'm #Gonna make you <i>ache</i> #Grin @TempFlag(AV_RuinHorny)
But before I can ruin you like I really want @SetVar[AV_RuinHorny]=[0] 
I'm #Gonna have to build you up so bad that it will absolutely <i>kill</i> you to have to take your hand away
Only when you're <i>that</i> desperate
Will I let you ruin it all for me #Grin @RapidCodeOn
