[yes] So that's something you're into...
[no] Then don't waste my time talking about it @Goto(waste my time)

(Yes First)
I know #PetName
You'll just have to wait and see #Smile
@End
(Yes Second)
You already said so #SubName stop bothering me
I'll decide when we get there
It certainly doesn't improve your chances to nag about it
@End
(Yes Third)
You think if you keep asking you'll get what you want?
[yes] That's not how it works #Name
[no] You're right about that #Laugh
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
So you can just stop asking
@End
(Yes Fourth)
Shut up #PetName @CBTBalls
I told you to stop nagging about it

I thought you didn't like that #SubName
Did you change your mind?
[yes] That's interesting, I'll keep it in mind @DeleteFlag(pthevCEI_No) @SetFlag(av_fetish_cei)
[no] Then don't waste my time talking about it @Goto(waste my time)
@DifferentAnswer Do you want to eat your own cum, yes or no?
(maybe today)
Maybe I'll let you lick it up #GeneralTime

(Never Allows)
Although that would mean you get to cum
And we both know that's not going to happen
@End
(Rarely Allows)
Although that would mean you get to cum, which is pretty unlikely
But you never know, stranger things have happened #Smile
@End
(Sometimes Allows)
You have to cum first of course
And I haven't made my mind up about that yet, #PetName #Grin
@End
(Often Allows)
That would at least solve the problem of cleaning up
In case you get to cum today
@End
(Always Allows)
That would at least solve the problem of cleaning up #Laugh
@End
(waste my time)
Think before you type, #Name
