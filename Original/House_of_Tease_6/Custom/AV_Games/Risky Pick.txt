I bet those edges from our Risky Pick game aren't doing you any favors @Chance50(Screw It)
But honestly
If it didn't make your #Cock ache like crazy
It wouldn't be of any interest to me in the first place #Grin
@End
(Screw It)
Screw it @RapidTextOn
Let's add another one right now #Grin
Edge @Edge @RapidTextOff
#LetTheEdgeFade
That's what I love about Risky Pick
Win or lose, that #Cock is gonna feel the edge either way #Grin
