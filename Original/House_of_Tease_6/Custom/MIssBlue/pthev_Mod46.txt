#Edge @EdgeNoHold
I just can't get enough of making you do that #Smile @CheckFlag(pvMod17WonGameAgain)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
@RT(Making you squirm right on the brink of orgasm,Getting you so close to that orgasm you crave,Bringing you so close to orgasm you can barely contain it)
And then @RT(snatching,taking) it away from you
Over and over again @TempFlag(pvMod46Skip)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
I could keep doing this a long time, #PetName
A <i>very</i> long time #Grin @CheckFlag(pvMod17WonGame)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
You see, for you this is @RT(torture,agony) over and over again
But for me...
I just @RT(toss out some instructions,type some words), #Name #Laugh
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Who do you think will @RT(grow tired of,get enough of,fed up with) this first...
You or me?
[you] Oooh I do like a challenge... @Goto(i like a challenge)
[me] Probably, yes #Laugh
@DifferentAnswer Me or you, #Name?
I'm a bit disappointed, I must say...
Oh well, maybe some other time
That would be an interesting game of chicken
I'm sure at some point I'd get bored of making you edge
So it's not like you could never win this game @Goto(anyway even if)
(i like a challenge)
#Edge @EdgeHold
Sooner or later, you won't feel the difference 
Between the end of the last edge, and the start of the next
They'll just bleed together
#Edge @MultipleEdges(3,6) @EdgeNoHold
Are you ready to throw the towel yet?
[yes] Aww, already? @Goto(throwing the towel)
[no] Okay then
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
This could go on for a bit @CustomMode(#pvCantTakeIt,Goto,throwing the towel)
If you want to give up, just say so #Smile @CustomMode(#pvGiveUp,Goto,throwing the towel)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
I didn't even make you hold that one
So don't say I never gave you a chance, #Name
#Edge @MultipleEdges(5,9,100) @EdgeNoHold
Like I said, it just typing words for me
<i>You</i> are doing all the hard work here
And it's about to get a lot harder...
#Edge @MultipleEdges(7,5,100) @EdgeNoHold
All you have to say is "I give up" and it will end, #Name
I have to admit, I didn't think you'd get this far
And as much as I like having sit there and suffer edge after edge...
I'm also getting a bit impatient...
#Edge @MultipleEdges(9,5,100) @EdgeHold
Just say those three little words and you're done
You will have lost, but you'd be done #Smile
No?
Okay then...
#Edge @MultipleEdges(12,5,100) @EdgeHold
Well...? @Wait(6)
Not bad, #PetName @MoodUp
You did like 35 edges just now, maybe more
Let's do 10 more and say it's an even 50
And, okay, you'll have won the game if you make it through
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
Just nine more
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
That's two, still eight to go
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
The phrase I'm looking for is "I give up" #EmoteWink
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
You're not going to let victory slip away this late in the game, right?
#Edge @EdgeHold
Okay, 5 more
Let's do them in a row, make sure to hold the last one
#Edge @MultipleEdges(5,5) @Edge(LongHold,HoldTaunts)
#LetTheEdgeFade @CustomMode(#pvCantTakeIt,Normal)
Wow... @CustomMode(#pvGiveUp,Normal) 
Colour me impressed, #SubName #Smile @MoodBest
And yes, you win, congrats @TempFlag(pvMod17WonGame)
Your #Cock must be throbbing like madman now though, right?
[yes] I don't mind losing so much then #Grin
[no] That's hard to believe @MoodDown
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
In any case, you got quite the workout #GeneralTime
@End
(throwing the towel)
I knew I'd win this game eventually
There never was any doubt about that, was there?
[yes,there was,thought i'd win,can win,will win] If that's what you want to believe #Smile
[no,can't win,impossible,not possible] I'm sorry #SubName, but my games are rarely fair I suppose
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
The thing is, I don't like losing
When I play with you, I can change the rules in my favour at any time
So losing isn't really an issue #Laugh
(anyway even if)
And anyway, even if you did win this game
The amount of edging to achieve that would be enormous
So in a way I win even if I lose #Laugh
@End
(pvMod17WonGame)
But then again...
Even I wasn't prepared for just how much of an edge slut you are
I already tried to break you and failed #EmoteSad
#Edge @MultipleEdges(3,6) @Edge(ExtremeHold,HoldTaunts)
#LetTheEdgeFade
What if I made you hold 50 of those really long edges
What I'm trying to say is...
I can't stand it that you won the first round of our 'game of edging chicken'
So I'm going to make damn sure I win round 2...
Want to play? #Grin
[yes] You're a brave #PetName @Goto(ready for round two)
[no] Ha, chicken!
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Maybe some other time, if you can muster the courage
@End
(ready for round two)
When you want to give up, just tell me so
@NullResponse @CustomMode(#pvCantTakeIt,Goto, no more please)
@NullResponse @CustomMode(#pvGiveUp,Goto, no more please)
#Edge @MultipleEdges(5,5) @Edge(LongHold,HoldTaunts)
Anything you want to say?
Maybe three words in particular?
It's going to get ugly, #PetName
#Edge @MultipleEdges(8,6) @Edge(ExtremeHold,HoldTaunts)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Get ready for the next one
Unless, of course...
Nah, you wouldn't want to give up
You're having way too much fun!
#Edge @MultipleEdges(12,5) @Edge(ExtremeHold,HoldTaunts)
You must be the most depraved edge slut in the history of the universe
Maybe there was an even bigger slut among the cave men of the stone age
I mean, what else were they going to do all day...
But you... wow...
#Edge @MultipleEdges(15,9) @Edge(ExtremeHold,HoldTaunts)
It's not even funny anymore @TempFlag(pvMod17WonGameAgain)
Let's just move on to something else @MoodWorst
This isn't going anywhere 
Yeah, you win, good for you
@BallTorture @NullResponse @CBTBalls
I'm not playing this game anymore
@End
(no more please)
#Yay I win this round! Suck it, #PetName!
Alright, enough with the games already @TempFlag(pvMod17WonGameAgain)

As if you haven't been edging enough already #GeneralTime right?
Well in my opinion, there's no such thing as "enough" edging #Grin
