(talked about app)
I don't think I'll ever get enough of this
And I suspect that neither will you #Grin
I'm going to make sure you won't
I'm going to make you feel so horny and weak
That you'll have no choice than to come back to me
Again and again
And you'll beg me <i>not</i> to let you cum
Because you'll want that feeling to last
Just you wait and see, #PetName #Grin @SetFlag(pvMod37A)
@End
(should have an app)
You know what would be amazing?
If I had an app where I could see exactly how horny you were #Smile
That way I would know exactly how many edges until your breaking point...
Fuck... that would be perfect @Glitter(pvGL_Mod12-01)
It would have an ache-o-meter with a needle showing the level of ache 
You'd go into the red a <i>lot</i>, #SubName #Laugh @SetFlag(pvMod12AppDone)
#Edge @Edge
I think your ache-o-meter just spiked #Grin @AddContact1
@Contact1 What's this about creating an app?
Oh I was just thinking, what if I had an app measuring how horny #SubName is
@Contact1 That... just blew my mind...
I know, right? #Laugh
With a little ache-o-meter
@Contact1 #Lol You could check his levels any time of day
@Contact1 And if they are getting too low...
I'd text him: #PetName 5 edges, now!
@Contact1 OMG #Lol
@Contact1 Well, you don't necessarily need an app for that
@Contact1 #SubName...
@Contact1 Edge for us, now! @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(5,5,100)
Do you think someone could create an app like that?
@Contact1 I don't know, measuring arousal would be tricky I guess
@Contact1 You could measure heart rate and stuff like that
@Contact1 But maybe he's at the gym and his heart rate is up because of that
#SubName is jogging in the park and I'm like: drop your pants, start #JerkingOff #Laugh
@Contact1 Right #Laugh
@Contact1 But what do I know, I'm no app expert 
@Contact1 It would definitely be a revolution in teasing #Smile
No doubt @RemoveContact1
I guess I have to keep teasing you the old-fashioned way for now, #Name @SetFlag(pvMod37A)

Think about how many people must be having sex at this very moment @DeleteFlag(pvMod37A) @SetFlag(pvMod37B)
I mean actual, skin shredding, cum drenching, mind blowing sexual intercourse #Smile
Maybe really close to wherever you are sitting right now
Maybe you can even hear a couple though the walls and windows
At any given second, lots of people are doing it all over the place
And here you are, #JerkingOff
My little masturbation puppet
#Edge @Edge @MultipleEdges(3,7,50)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Come to think of it, what am <i>I</i> doing??
I could be having me some of that amazing sex, yet here I am
Giving masturbation instructions to... you...
The difference is of course, that I can have sex whenever I want to
I doubt that's the case for you...

You're going to do some strokes to a timer now @DeleteFlag(pvMod37B)
That means you have to finish the set I give you before the clock runs out
It's going to be fun, I promise #EmoteHappy
But don't edge or it's not going to be so much fun anymore #EmoteWink
