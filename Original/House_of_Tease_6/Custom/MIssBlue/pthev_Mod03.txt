#StopStroking @StopStroking
Do you like @RT(edging,it when I make you edge,getting to the edge) #PetName?
[yes] Good #Smile
[no] Good, I @RT(love,like,do enjoy) @RT(putting you through,making you do,it when you have to endure) @RT(stuff,things) you don't @RT(like,want to,actually enjoy) #Grin
@AcceptAnswer I @RT(love,like,do enjoy) making you edge
#Edge @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade @CheckFlag(pvMod03A)
I'm going to show you some pictures, #Name @SetFlag(pvMod03A)
You're going to give me 10 full strokes for each picture
And no more than 10 stokes
Except when it's a pic of a blowjob...
A blowjob means you have to edge #Smile
Is that clear?
[yes] Good @Goto(canstart)
[no,explain,dont understand,unclear] It's perfectly simple #PetName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Every new picture means you stroke your #Cock 10 times
But when I show you a picture of a blowjob you have to edge as fast as you can
Okay?
[yes,okay,understood,clear] It's not exactly rocket science is it @Goto(canstart)
[no] Now you're just yanking my chain #Name
@AcceptAnswer Now you're just yanking my chain #Name
When really, I should be yanking yours
(canstart)
So let's begin!
This is a nice one to start off with @ShowSoftcoreImage @LockImages
You don't have to tell me every time you did your 10 strokes
Just make sure you do them all
Like right now @ShowBoobsImage
You can do the math #PetName
If I showed you each and every one of the pics in your collection
How many strokes would that be... @ShowHardcoreImage
A lot #Laugh
Ooh BJ alert! You know what that means @ShowBlowjobImage @Edge
You have quite a few blowjob pictures too
What if I made you edge to all of them #GeneralTime
That would really mess you up @ShowSoftcoreImage
I don't think you could handle it
10 strokes for this #Ass #Name @ShowButtImage @Wait(12)
@NullResponse @ShowBlowjobImage @Edge
I don't even have to tell you anything anymore @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Goto,need break)
I can let the pictures do the talking
@NullResponse @ShowFemdomImage @SetVar[pthev_Mod03edges]=[0]
(BackUp)
@NullResponse @If[pthev_Mod03edges]>[5]Then(end)
@NullResponse @Goto(FDimage,LDimage,Butt,Boob,LesImage,HCimage,BJimage,BJimage,BJimage)

(end)
Last one, #PetName @ShowBlowjobImage @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade @UnlockImages @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Normal)
We could go on like this forever
But there are so many other ways I can torment you #Grin
@End
(need break)
@NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_BreakStroking.txt)
I hope you still remember what to do... @Goto(BackUp)
(pvMod03A)
There is something I like more than making you edge
And that's making you edge twice in a row #Grin
Get to the edge, #PetName @Edge @MultipleEdges(2,6,100)
#LetTheEdgeFade
And if you can do 2 in a row... you know what I'm going to say, right?
The thing with edging is, more is always better @CustomMode(#pvDontWantTo,Goto,no more edging)
It might not feel that way for you, but most of the time I feel like I don't do it enough
Making you edge, I mean @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Goto,no more edging)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(3,7,100)
#LetTheEdgeFade
So that was three in a row...
You're probably starting to worry a little now, aren't you?
You're thinking: is she going to tell me to do 4 in a row next? @CheckFlag(pvMod03B)
And then 5? Then 6? @SetFlag(pvMod03B)
How far is this going to go?
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(4,6,100)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Have you had enough yet, #Name?
[yes] Oh... you know that's not the right answer, right? #Laugh
[no] Good #Smile
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Because I'm not done yet
You already know how many this is going to be...
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(5,8,100)
#LetTheEdgeFade @CheckFlag(pvMod03C)
1+2+3+4+5=15 edges... I hadn't realised how quickly this adds up, #Name @SetFlag(pvMod03C)
I should probably let you regain your strength for a minute @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Normal) 
On the other hand... why stop now, right? #Laugh @CustomMode(#pvDontWantTo,Normal)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
@End
(pvMod03C)
This is what I like to call an edge ladder, #Name @DeleteFlag(pvMod03C)
You've climbed 5 rungs so far
@NullResponse @CustomMode(#pvDontWantTo,Normal)
@NullResponse @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Normal)
So now I'm going to give you a choice
Option 1: you complete your ladder, in other words: climb down from 4 back to 1
That means another 10 edges #Grin
Option 2: only 1 edge, but you have to hold it
AND 5 ball smacks for each of the edges you skipped, so that's 45 smacks
Which one do you choose, option 1 or option 2?
[1,one] Excellent choice, I hate to leave an edge ladder unfinished #EmoteHappy @Goto(finish the ladder)
[2,two] I was hoping you'd say that #Grin 
@DifferentAnswer 1 or 2?
@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvBallsTied,balls are tied)
@Flag(pthevShoelace) I think this will work best if those #Balls are tied up @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_TieMyBalls.txt)
(balls are tied)
@Flag(pvSpoon) Get the wooden spoon, you're going to use is to do the smacking
45 ball smacks, get to it
And don't hold back, #Name - you know I wouldn't @Wait(20)
Done?
[yes,done,ready,finished] Good #PetName #Smile
[no] Let me know when you're done @LoopAnswer
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you're done
And then there's that one edge that you still owe me...
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Maybe next time you'll opt for finishing the ladder #Smile
@End
(finish the ladder)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(4,6,100)
That was rung 4, just relax for a moment
Going down the ladder is much easier, isn't it?
The next one is only 3 edges, so no sweat!
Well, maybe a little sweat, and some precum #Laugh
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(3,7,100)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Almost there, #Name
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(2,5,100)
Let that poor #Cock throb now... get ready for the last one
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Good job on getting down the ladder, #Name
Maybe next time we'll climb one a bit taller #Smile
@End
(pvMod03B)
I'm not going to do that this time, #Name @DeleteFlag(pvMod03B)
Instead, I'm going to jump straight to 6! #Grin
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(6,7,100)
