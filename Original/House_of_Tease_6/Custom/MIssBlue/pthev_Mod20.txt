@Flag(pvKneeling) Get up off your knees @DeleteFlag(pvKneeling)
You're going to @RT(thank me for,be grateful for,be happy you had) this @RT(little break,break from stroking,moment of rest) soon, #Name
Because the thing I'm going to do to you next... @SetFlag(pvMod20A)
It's going to @RT(destroy you,wreck you,mess you up,fuck you up,turn you into a quivering mess) #Grin
I'm going to count from 1 to 10
And with each number, you have to give that many strokes
So 1 means 1 stoke, 2 means 2 strokes, 3 means 3, and so on
But I'm going to count at a steady pace...
So you'll have to stroke faster and faster to keep up
Make sure you do all your strokes, #PetName
If you hit the edge, just tell me
You'll work yourself into a frenzy before you know what hit you #Smile
Wrap you hand around that #Cock @SetVar[pvMod20EdgeCount]=[0]
Get ready, #Name @EdgeMode(Goto,got to the edge)

Let's reverse it this time

And then you'll slow down gradually...

Hands off @EdgeMode(Normal)
That last one wasn't so bad, I guess
Though it was probably pretty frustrating to slow down, right?
Well, we're not done yet, #Name
(do another round)

@End
(second time frenzy)
Fuck, that was hot... #Smile
It gets harder to keep up each time, doesn't it?
[yes] It's such a great way to make you very, <i>very</i> horny #Grin
[no] Maybe we should do this more often then
@AcceptAnswer It's such a great way to make you very, <i>very</i> horny #Grin
I can keep doing this all day, #Name @Goto(do another round)
@End
(third time frenzy)
#LetTheEdgeFade
You're doing great #Smile
And you know that the more aroused you get...
The more you make me happy
That's all that should matter to you in the end
You do want to make me happy,don't you?
[yes] Good boy #Smile
[no] Yet somehow you can't help it
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
You are helpless in my hands, #Name
I fucking <i>own</i> you
And even if you feel doubt itching in the back of your mind sometimes
In your heart of hearts you know
That you wouldn't have it any other way

#StopStroking @StopStroking
Tease that #Cock a little bit, #Name @DeleteFlag(pvMod20A)
Fondle it, run your fingers up and down @SetFlag(pvMod20B)
Don't stroke
Just play with it #Smile
It's so hard isn't it?
You can play with your #Balls too
Cup them, roll them between your fingers
#Name...
Would you like to edge for me again?
[yes] Not until I allow it, #PetName
[no] Aww #Laugh @Goto(do not want to edge)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
I might make you edge a <i>long</i> time
Are you sure you want that?
[yes] It might be one really long edge
[no] Did I scare you off? #Laugh @Goto(do not want to edge)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Or it might be a long series of short edges
I might take you all the way to your breaking point
Do you still want it?
[yes] Okay, #PetName #Smile
[no] Coward... #EmoteWink @Goto(do not want to edge)
@DifferentAnswer
Here we go... @Chance33(series of short edges)
#Edge @Edge(ExtremeHold,HoldTaunts)
#LetTheEdgeFade @Goto(continue after edging)
(series of short edges)
#Edge @MultipleEdges(10,6) @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
(continue after edging)
Oh that blissful agony... @Chance50(say thank you)
That point where you want it to go on forever 
And yet you almost can't bear it
That's exactly where I want you, #Name
I get the feeling it's where you want to be too
You seem to spend a lot of time there #Laugh
@End
(do not want to edge)
Maybe you've already done enough edging #GeneralTime
@End
(say thank you)
You love it so fucking much, don't you #PetName
And I know you love me for giving you so much of it
So the next time you get to the edge
You're going to hold it, and while holding it...
I want you to say "thank you for making me edge #DomHonorific #DomName" out loud
And I mean <i>loud</i>, #PetName
Get to the edge @EdgeHold
Now, there's no way I could have heard you say it
So I need you to be honest, #PetName
Did you say it out loud?
[yes] Good #EmoteHappy @MoodUp @Goto(try again)
[no] Tsk tsk, bad #PetName @MoodDown
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
You should always do as I say
@BallTorture @NullResponse @CBTBalls
Now let's try again
(try again)
I'm going to let you hold another edge
And this time you will say "I will do whatever you want, #DomHonorific #DomName"
Out <i>loud</i>, #Name
#Edge @EdgeHold
Did you do it?
[yes] #Smile @MoodUp @Goto(try it one more time)
[no] You do know how to make me unhappy, #Name @MoodDown
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Now #PetName
@BallTorture You do realise I tend to take that out on your #Balls, don't you? @CBTBalls
@BallTorture You know what I think?
@BallTorture I think you like the pain just a little too much... #Laugh
(try it one more time)
Let's try it one more time
It's a good way of reinforcing that submissive state of mind
That brings you back to me whether you want to or not #Smile
This time when you reach the edge
I want you to say "you own me, #DomHonorific #DomName"
I want you to say it over and over again
Until I tell you to stop holding the edge
#Edge @Edge(LongHold)
#LetTheEdgeFade
I'm not going to ask you if you did what I said this time
I think you did it
And if not, you will feel guilty about it
No need for me to tell you you did good or bad
You know it
And you know you want to be good for me
Because it will make you feel good too #Smile

#StopStroking @StopStroking
Good boy #Smile @DeleteFlag(pvMod20B)
Can you take more for me?
[yes] Yes, you should always be ready and willing to take more for me @MoodUp
[no] Oh that's too bad... too bad for <i>you</i> @MoodDown
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Because I'm only asking to see if you'd give the right answer
I don't really care whether you can take more, you're going to do as I say anyway @CustomTask(Strokes)
