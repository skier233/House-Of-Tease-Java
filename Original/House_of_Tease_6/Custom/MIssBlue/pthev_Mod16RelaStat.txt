Of course you can #Grin
How about this #Name @ShowCaptionsImage
Is this how you want her to treat you?
[yes] Be careful what you wish for #SubName
[no] Then you better make sure she never finds this little collection of yours
@AcceptAnswer @NullResponse
Maybe I'll look for her on facebook and send her this picture
It's surprisingly easy to find people these days #Grin @UnlockImages
Don't worry #SubName, I'm just teasing you #Smile
I was wondering, since you don't have a girlfriend
How long has it been since you've had sex...
Like, has it been weeks, months or years?
[days] You're such a slut #Lol @Goto(such a slut)
[weeks] That's not that bad @Goto(such a slut)
[months] At least you have some memory of having sex then #Smile @Goto(such a slut)
[years] Ouch, that must be tough @Goto(such a slut)
[never, haven't had sex, virgin, not had sex] @NullResponse
@DifferentAnswer So, weeks, months or years? Or never...
Oh really, you're still a virgin? 
[yes] Wow... @SetFlag(pthevVirgin)
[no] Sorry, I must have misunderstood then @Goto(such a slut)
