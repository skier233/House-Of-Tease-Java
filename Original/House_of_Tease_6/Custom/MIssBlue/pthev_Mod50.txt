Let's play a game, #Name @CheckFlag(pvMod19playedpics)
I'm going to show you some pictures @SetFlag(pvMod19playedpics)
With every new picture, you will stroke faster than the last @SetVar[pvMod19pics]=[0]
The trick is to speed up ever so slightly with each picture
The game ends when you get to the edge
So just tell me when you do
Let's see how long you can last #Smile @EdgeMode(Goto,edge to pictures)
#StartStroking @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1] @LockImages
#StrokeSlowest
A little bit faster now @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1]
It should still be pretty slow though
Speed up a little again @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1]
If you do this right, it could take a long time #EmoteHappy
#StrokeFaster @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1]
Do <i>not</i> slow down at any time, #PetName
#StrokeFaster @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1] @Wait(6)
#StrokeFaster @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1]
Keep going #Smile
Keep that pace until the next picture
#StrokeFaster @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1]
This is all about concentration, #Name
Focus and self control

@NullResponse @Goto(edge loop)

Stop touching, #Name @EdgeMode(Normal) @UnlockImages
So you got through @ShowVar[pvMod19pics] pictures, #SubName
That doesn't tell us much, does it @SetVar[pvMod19picslast]=[pvMod19pics]
We'll have to play this game again soon
Then you can try set a new record... #Smile

(pvMod19playedpics)
Do you remember that game where you start slow
And then stroke faster with each picture?
[yes] Good, let's play right now #EmoteHappy
[no] Doesn't matter, it's really simple #Smile
@DifferentAnswer Do you remember, yes or no?
With each picture you have to speed up your strokes, until you edge
Your personal best so far is @ShowVar[pvMod19picslast] pictures
I keep track of everything, #SubName #Laugh
Try to beat that record, #Name! @SetVar[pvMod19pics]=[0]
#StartStroking  @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1] @LockImages @EdgeMode(Goto,edge to pictures again)
#StrokeSlowest
You don't want to get to the edge too soon
A little bit faster @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1]
You do want to improve your score, don't you?
#StrokeFaster @ShowBlogImage @ChangeVar[pvMod19pics]=[pvMod19pics]+[1] @Wait(6)

At least you get to look at some hot images #EmoteHappy

Too bad, you only got to @ShowVar[pvMod19pics]
The old record still stands!
Better luck next time, #PetName

(new record)
You did it #EmoteHappy
And the new record is... *drum roll*
@ShowVar[pvMod19pics]!
Great job, #SubName @SetVar[pvMod19picslast]=[pvMod19pics]
We'll see how long this record will stand #EmoteWink

Owning a #Cock is so much fun, it's almost like a pet

Stop! Hands off...
It's like a dog I can teach tricks
Sitting pretty is especially easy #Giggles

@Flag(pvBallsTied) I keep this little doggie on a tight leash, too #Grin

@Flag(pthevCompleteControlYES) Can you even remember what it was like to be the proud owner of a #Cock?
@Flag(pthevCompleteControlYES) You are so lucky to have me to control your #Cock, #Name
A #Cock needs to be trained... just like a dog, it's not born obedient

Grab your #Balls and squeeze them for me, #PetName @DeleteFlag(pvMod50B) @DeleteFlag(pvMod50A)
Not too tight, just a nice tight grip
As you squeeze I want you to move your hand up and down to make your #Cock bounce
Not just once, keep doing it, keep bouncing that #Cock up and down @Wait(6)
You look pretty silly doing that, don't you think? #Giggles
Bounce it harder, #Name
There should be precum flying across the room... @Wait(8)
You can stop now
Hands off your #Balls
Tease that sensitive head of your #Cock
Rub it very lightly with the palm of your hand
Think about rubbing your cock between my #Boobs
If it actually was <i>your</i> cock, maybe I'd let you do that for real
Maybe I would wrap my lips around the shaft 
And take it all the way into my wet mouth and down my throat...
But it's not your cock, is it?
You don't own that toy between your legs, it's <i>mine</i>
So giving it pleasure wouldn't do you any good anyway
@CockTorture @NullResponse @CBTCock
Hands off my cock, just let it bounce in the air now
That #Cock is just a means to an end, #PetName
It's an object that I can use to tease and torment you
Nothing more
