Hmm
Does that seem right to you?
[yes] Well I think you're not aching enough to stop stroking yet
[no] No me neither, you're not aching enough to stop stroking yet
[what,understand,you mean] Was it time to stop stroking already? @LoopAnswer
@AcceptAnswer I think you're not aching enough to stop stroking yet
So get to the edge, #PetName @EdgeHold @PlayAudio[tease\cEdge.mp3]

There are few thing that give me more pleasure than telling a boy what to do @CheckFlag(pvMod382A)
If only I could make more use of that around the house @SetFlag(pvMod382A)
I could definitely use someone to do my laundry and cleaning
Who knows, maybe some day, hm? #Smile

#Edge @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade @If[#SessionEdges]<[6]Then(not too many)
And that was edge number #SessionEdges for today
Give or take a few, it's hard to keep track isn't it #Laugh
(not too many)
That was only edge number #SessionEdges so far #GeneralTime
There will be more coming I'm sure #Grin

#StopStroking @StopStroking @BadMood(in a bad mood)
You're doing fine so far, #PetName
I don't know if I tell you that often enough
There's no reason to feel bad about yourself or to be ashamed to be here
I'm having a great time and if you are too, then it's all good #Smile
