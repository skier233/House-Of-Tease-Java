#StopStroking @StopStroking
Take a deep breath and relax @SetFlag(pvMod19A)
Because...
I'm about to mess you up bad, #Name #Grin
#StartStroking
@NullResponse
#StrokeFaster
That's good, #Name
Keep going at that pace
But don't edge, loosen your grip if you have to
I'm going to make you edge in a bit, but not yet
For now, I want you to keep #JerkingOff
I want to build you up good
I want you desperate to cum
This next edge that's coming up...
It's going to be a long one #Grin
It's going to be mind-bending
I think you know why I make you stuff like that, #Name
The more I make you edge, the more desperate you become
And the more desperate you become...
The more willing to obey #Smile
You must have some hard limits, #SubName
Things you would never do, even for me
Think of one as you continue to build up
You know #SubName, the more aroused you get...
The more those 'hard' limits start to soften
They start to weaken
Think of something you would never do
Imagine doing it in front of me
And get to the edge right now @Edge(ExtremeHold,HoldTaunts)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Whatever it was you thought about just now
Could you see yourself doing it for me?
[yes] That's the power of arousal, #SubName
[no] Then you still weren't aroused enough #Laugh
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
You know I'd never @RT(force you to,make you,pressure you to) do anything @RT(you don't want to do,against your will)
But the more you ache for me
The more you'll want to @RT(submit,yield) to @RT(me,my will)
The more @RT(you are mine,I own you)
And you do want that, don't you?
[yes] Good #Smile
[no] Someone needs a couple more extreme edges... #Grin

How about I let you choose this time
Do you want...
To bust your balls or to edge and hold it for a long time?
[bust,balls] Good choice #EmoteHappy @Goto(i choose balls)
[edge,hold] I hope you're not going to regret your choice, #Name
@DifferentAnswer Bust balls or hold edge, #Name?
Because I might let you hold it a <i>very</i> long time #Grin
#Edge @Edge(LongHold,HoldTaunts)
#LetTheEdgeFade
@End
(i choose balls)
I do always like busting your #Balls and I'm glad you agree @CBTBalls
Those poor #Balls...
Well, it was your choice so you must enjoy getting them beat up #Laugh

Does it hurt when I make you edge so much?
[yes] Aww and I thought I was doing you a favour! #Lol
[no] Good, because there are other things I can do to accomplish that #Grin
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Do you think I make you edge too much or too little?
[much] #Grin @Goto(too much edging)
[little] Oh... then we need to do more! @Goto(need to do more)
[enough,just right,right amount,neither,perfect,good] Hm...
@DifferentAnswer Too much or too little?
That's good then, I suppose
Except it isn't, #Name
I don't want to edge you 'just enough'
I want to edge you to your breaking point
I want to edge you until you can't take it anymore
I want to edge you <i>too much</i> #Grin
#Edge @MultipleEdges(9,5) @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
That's more like it #Laugh
And if you're think I'm being cruel...
You haven't seen the least of it #Grin

Everyone has a limit, #Name
@RT(My job is,I just need) to find yours...

It's not that I'm <i>trying</i> to be cruel
You just make it so easy #Grin

@RT(My job is,I just need) to find yours...

#Edge @Edge
