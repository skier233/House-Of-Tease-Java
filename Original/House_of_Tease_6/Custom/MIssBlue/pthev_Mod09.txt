Let's do a little training exercise #PetName
(explain again)
This exercise is not about how fast you can go
But how <i>slow</i>
In a moment you're going to hear a bell
This bell @PlayAudio[PtheV\bell.mp3]
When you do, I want you to start stroking at a very slow pace
1 full stroke up and down every 5 seconds
You will count your strokes: up and down counts as one stroke
I will keep time, and at the end we'll see how well you've kept pace #Smile @SetFlag(pthevMod09NoInstructions)
You have to stop stroking when you hear the bell, clear?
[yes] Good @Goto(and no cheating)
[no] It's not that hard #PetName
[how long,how much time] You'll know when the bell rings again #Smile @Goto(and no cheating)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
When you hear the bell, start stroking at 1 stroke per 5 seconds
Count your strokes
When you hear the bell again, stop stroking
Then I will ask you how many strokes you did
(and no cheating)
And no cheating by looking at the clock #SubName! @Goto(eighty,ninety,hundred)
(pthevMod09NoInstructions)
Let's do another slow-stroking exercise
You remember the rules, right?
[yes] Alright, then let's play #Smile
[no] Then let me explain, again... *sigh* @Goto(explain again)

Get ready...
@NullResponse @RapidTextOn @AFKOn
Go! @PlayAudio[PtheV\bell.mp3] @Wait(90)
@NullResponse @PlayAudio[PtheV\bell.mp3]
@NullResponse @RapidTextOff @AFKOff
That was the bell, you better stop stroking #PetName @CheckFlag(pvMod09ninetydone)
How many strokes did you do? @TempFlag(pvMod09ninetydone)
[lost count, don't know] Better start over then, #PetName @Goto(ninety)
[18,eighteen] That's exactly the right amount! @Goto(ninety right)
[16,sixteen] You're a little bit off target, #SubName @Goto(ninety almost right)
[17,seventeen] Oooh so close...! @Goto(ninety almost right)
[19,nineteen] Close, but no @Goto(ninety almost right)
[20,twenty] A few too many, you got greedy #SubName @Goto(ninety almost right)
@AcceptAnswer @RT(Oh no,Nope,Oh dear), that's @RT(not even close,way off the mark) #Laugh
I guess we'll have to start over, #Name @Goto(ninety)
(ninety right)
As a reward you can edge for me now #Smile @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade
@End
(ninety almost right)
But because you were close, I won't let you start over
@BallTorture You're going to have to endure some pain though #Grin @CBTBalls
Maybe next time you'll do better #Smile

@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Because I've had about enough of this game
It's as boring for me as it is frustrating for you #Lol
