Let's talk about edging for a moment
Edging and submission
See, #Contact1 and I have this theory
That the more you edge, the more submissive you become
#Edge @Edge
Now, I'm not talking about edging because you want to...
But edging because I tell you to do it
#Edge @EdgeHold
When you edge on command...
When you let someone else control you and edge you into a frenzy...
That's when true submission starts #Smile
But that's not as easy as it sounds, #Name
To reach that point
I have to make you edge so many times that you'll beg me to stop
But #PetName, your desire to obey...
Will always be stronger than your self-preservation instinct
Especially when you're edging your brains out #Grin
#Edge @EdgeMode(Goto,no need to say)
Arousal makes you more open to suggestion
And what better way to create arousal than to edge...
Come on, #PetName edge for me
(edge loop)
#Edge @EdgeMode(Goto,no need to say)
@NullResponse
@NullResponse
@NullResponse
@NullResponse @EdgeMode(Normal) @Goto(edge loop)
(no need to say)
For the next few edges, you don't have to tell me when you edge @EdgeMode(Normal)
Just hold the edge until I let you stop stroking
@NullResponse @CustomMode(#pvDontWantTo,Goto,do not want)
@NullResponse @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Goto,need break)
@NullResponse @CustomMode(#pvCantTakeIt,Goto,do not want)
#Edge @EdgeMode(Goto,told you not to)
Arousal makes you obedient, #PetName
It makes you more eager to serve me
There are all kinds of commands I can give you
All of which you will happily obey
But none of them deepen your commitment to me
The way the command to edge does
#StopStroking
That's because when you edge, you are in a kind of limbo
You want to cum, but you don't want to stop either
Shivers down your spine
Your #Cock throbbing
You want to keep feeling that glorious agony
#Edge
But of course, you don't get that feeling from one edge
You have to do it over and over again
And that feeling builds with every second you spend on the edge @Wait(10)
#StopStroking
Are you starting to feel it yet, #PetName?
The edge will come faster and faster each time
#Edge
Edging feels good, doesn't it #PetName
Edging feels better than cumming, even
Because an orgasm is over in the blink of an eye
But edging...?
Edging can go on and on
#StopStroking
This will be a very short break #Grin
#Edge
Do you see how easy it's becoming to obey that command?
Only a few strokes and you're right back at the edge
#StopStroking
Oh my poor helpless #PetName #Smile
#Edge
@NullResponse

#StopStroking
@CockTorture @NullResponse @CBTCock
#Edge
You should be edging almost instantly now, #Name
And then...
You will ride it...
Until...
I...
Say... @Wait(5)
#StopStroking @EdgeMode(Normal)
#LetTheEdgeFade
That's enough for now
I think you're starting to learn the meaning of the word <i>submission</i> #Smile
From now on you should tell me when you edge again,okay?
@End
(told you not to)
I told you not to say it, #PetName @MoodDown
But I guess even a simple command like that is too difficult for you...
#Edge @Edge(LongHold,HoldTaunts)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Don't think I'm letting you off so easy @Interrupt(pvInt_Punishment)
@End
(do not want)
Oh c'mon now, #PetName
You need to try harder, because this really won't do @Interrupt(pvInt_Punishment)
@End
(need break)
I guess you can take a break... @CallReturn(Custom/Break/*.txt)
Time for some more edges! #Grin
#Edge @EdgeHold
Mmm yes, maybe that break was just what you needed
But now what you need is to edge your fucking brains out...
#Edge @EdgeHold @MultipleEdges(3,6,50)
Do you feel that?
That's your mind leaking out through your #Cock #Grin 
#Edge @EdgeHold @MultipleEdges(5,8,100)
#LetTheEdgeFade
I'm gonna let you settle down for a second now
I feel like I was about to break your poor #Cock there...
@End
(pvMod39A)
#StopStroking @StopStroking @DeleteFlag(pvMod39A)
I think now you should...
Do some timed stroking, just try not to edge, #Name @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_TimedStrokingRandom.txt)
Did you finish the whole set?
[yes] Good #Smile @Goto(next set)
[no] Oh no no #EmoteSad
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
I thought you'd do better, #Name @Goto(how many missed)
(next set)
@NullResponse @Chance20(last one)
Let's do @RT(one more,another one,another set)... @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_TimedStrokingRandom.txt)
Did @RT(you manage to,you) @RT(complete,finish,do) @RT(the whole set,all your strokes,them all)?
[yes] Alright, @RT(well done,good job) @Goto(next set)
[no] Hmmm 
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
(how many missed)
How many strokes did you miss? @InputVar[pvHowManyMissed]
@RT(Alright,Okay,Well,Oh)...
@BallTorture Then you should slap your #Balls @ShowVar[pvHowManyMissed] times @Goto(when done)
Then you should do @ShowVar[pvHowManyMissed] situps right now
(when done)
Let me know when you're done, #Name
[done,did,finished,ready] Okay
@DifferentAnswer Tell me when you're done...
@NullResponse @Goto(next set)
@End
(last one)
Let's do one more @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_TimedStrokingRandom.txt)
Did @RT(you manage to,you) @RT(complete,finish,do) @RT(the whole set,all your strokes,them all)?
[yes] Alright, good job @Goto(end mod)
[no] Oh c'mon, #PetName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
#Edge @EdgeHold

Let's move on to something else now
