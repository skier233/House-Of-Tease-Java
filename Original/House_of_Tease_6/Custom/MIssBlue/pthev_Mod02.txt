I'll give you a moment to recover
You'll need it #Grin @CheckFlag(pthevMod2B)
In the mean time I'll give you something to look at @ShowHardcoreImage
Wouldn't you love to slide your #Cock between those lips @ShowTaggedImage @TagLesbian @TagKissing
That's not so nice of me is it... @ShowBlowjobImage
I give you a moment to recover, then show you all these hot images #Laugh
Recovering is overrated anyway, #Name @CheckFlag(pthevMod2C)
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
I wonder how many times you can do that
Before you go completely insane @Chance50(edgeagain)
I mean, at some point you'll probably just edge your brain away
Do you want to find out? #Grin
#Edge @EdgeHold
Let that #Cock rest a little bit now
Rub your #Balls 
Feel how full and swollen they are
So full of cum they could just burst
Does if feel good to rub them?
[yes] Good, keep rubbing them for me @Goto(edgeagain)
[no] Maybe you'd rather stroke your #Cock again
[hurt,hurts,hurting,painful,pain,aching,ache,sore] Aw poor you #Smile
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Squeeze your #Balls #PetName
Harder! #Grin
(edgeagain)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade @SetFlag(pthevMod2X)
@End 
(pthevMod2X)
#Edge @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade
I think you should do a couple more edges #Name
A throw of the dice will determine how many
Hold on a second @AFKOn @Wait(14)
Alright found the dice #Smile @DeleteFlag(pthevMod2X) @SetFlag(pthevMod2A) @AFKOff
Here we go... @Goto(1,2,3,4,5,6)
(1)
I threw a one #EmoteSad
Well let's get it over with then, edge for me #Name @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
At least I made the most out of that one edge #Grin
@End
(2)
It's a two... #EmoteSad
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Don't get too comfortable #SubName, one more to go 
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Two edges can still be pretty intense
@End
(3)
It's a three #SubName
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Two more to go...
Edge again! @EdgeNoHold
Relax #PetName only one more
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
I bet you #Cock is aching pretty good right now #Smile
@End
(4)
A four! That shouldn't be too much of a problem for a pro like you
Lets get started #SubName, edge for me @EdgeNoHold
Almost halfway #Laugh
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Don't get too comfortable now...
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
And the last one... edge #PetName @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Breath easy now, let your body relax
Are you okay #SubName?
[yes] Good #Smile
[no] That was pretty intense wasn't it
[intense,amazing,great] #Grin
[mean,cruel,bitch] I know #PetName I know #Grin
[aching,ache,hurts,hurting] You're doing great #PetName #Smile
@AcceptAnswer You're doing great #PetName
Maybe next time I'll "help" the dice a little 
Too make it even harder for you #Grin
@End
(5)
Oooh a five... make me proud #PetName #Smile
Give me my first edge! @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
If we do these quickly it'll just be like one very long edge
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
Relax and get ready #PetName @Wait(5)
Edge for me again @EdgeNoHold
That's three, only two more to go!
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
You're doing great, get ready for the last one
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Are you okay #SubName?
[yes] Good #Smile
[no] That was pretty intense wasn't it
[intense,amazing,great] #Grin
[mean,cruel,bitch] I know #PetName I know #Grin
[aching,ache,hurts,hurting] You're doing great #PetName #Smile
@AcceptAnswer You're doing great #PetName
May next time I'll use two dice #Grin
@End
(6)
Well, guess what #SubName
I threw a six and I didn't even cheat!
So let's begin, edge for me #Name @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
You'll be aching so much at the end of this #Grin
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade @Wait(10)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
This is fun, maybe I should use more dice though...
A maximum of six edges seems a bit easy
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
On the other hand, I don't want to completely ruin my toy
Not in such a short time anyway #Grin
Speaking of ruining things...
I'm seriously considering making you ruining an orgasm after edge number 6
Damn, was that last one number 4 or 5?
[4,four,fourth] I think so too
[5,five,fifth] Mmm I don't think so #Name
@AcceptAnswer I think it was 4, that means 2 more to go
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Okay get ready for the last one
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
So I decided not to make you ruin it after all @Timeout(8,edgesenough)
[thank you,thanks] You're welcome #Smile
[too bad] #Laugh it could still happen of course...
[please ruin,make me ruin,ruin it,love ruined,like ruined] #Laugh maybe later...
@AcceptAnswer I was thinking more of a "thank you", but okay...
(edgesenough)
After all those edges I thought ruining it would have a bit much
Like I said, I don't want to completely ruin my toy... yet #Grin
@End
(pthevMod2A)
Time to do some edges #Name
I've used dice before, but only one
This time I want you to throw the dice yourself
And I want you to use 2
So go get a pair of dice tell me when you're ready
[ready] Good. Now, you could cheat of course... @Goto(i trust you)
[no,don't have, haven't got] Hmm, there are other ways to do this
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you're ready
You can go to random.org/dice
Or google "dice", I'm sure you can find something @Wait(10)
Ready?
[yes,ready] Good. Now, you could cheat of course... @Goto(i trust you)
[no] God... just make sure you have a pair of dice next time, #PetName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
We'll just have to move on to something else I guess
@End
(i trust you)
But I trust you to do exactly as instructed #Smile
Okay #Name, throw the dice!
What number did you get?
[1,one] Very funny, what number did you really get? @LoopAnswer
[2,two] Damn, lucky you... @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[2]
[3,three] Only 3... it'll have to do @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[3]
[4,four] Could be higher @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[4]
[5,five] Okay then @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[5]
[6,six] I'd be happier had it been one die  @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[6]
[7,seven] Could be worse  @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[7]
[8,eight] Not bad  @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[8]
[9,nine] That's not bad  @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[9]
[10,ten] Alright, double digits!  @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[10]
[11,eleven] Alright, double digits!  @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[11]
[12,twelve] That's what I like to see!  @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[12]
@DifferentAnswer Seriously #SubName, what number?
Let's get it over with #Smile @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Goto,two need break)
(back to the top)
#Edge @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade @ChangeVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[pthevMod2Aedges]-[1]
@NullResponse @If[pthevMod2Aedges]=[0]Then(all edges done)
#pthevMod02EdgesLeft
@NullResponse @Goto(back to the top)
(all edges done)
That's all for now #Name @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Normal)
Although to be honest, that was probably not your last edge #GeneralTime @DeleteFlag(pthevMod2A) @SetFlag(pthevMod2B)
@End
(two need break)
@NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_BreakEdging.txt)
Let's continue where we left off... @Goto(back to the top)
(pthevMod2B)
Do you know what time it is?
Time to bring out the dice and do some edges #Smile
I think last time you used 2 dice, right? @Timeout(8,positive it was)
[yes] I think you can probably guess what I'm going to say next @Goto(positive it was)
[no] I'm pretty sure we used 2 dice last time, #PetName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
And since the time before that we used 1...
(positive it was)
This time we'll use 3 #Grin @DeleteFlag(pthevMod2B) @SetFlag(pthevMod2C)
Are you up for it?
[yes] I expected nothing else from you, #SubName #Smile
[no] That was a rhetorical question, it's not up for debate
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
So go get 3 dice, or go to random.org/dice or some other website
And let's see how many edges you get 
Ready?
[yes,ready] #Grin @Goto(throw three dice)
[no] Let me know when you are, I'll wait @LoopAnswer
[don't,won't,can't,please,will not,not possible,impossible,not going] So, this is going to be a problem...
@DifferentAnswer Are you ready?
Are you going to get the dice, yes or no?
[yes] Okay, good #Smile @Goto(throw three dice)
[no] I'm disappointed #SubName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
And I'm going to take it out on your #Balls @CBTBalls
@NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_PunishmentLight_NotStroking.txt)
Make sure next time you have 3 dice @MoodDown
@End
(throw three dice)
Throw the dice!
What number did you get?
[1,one] Very funny, what number did you really get? @LoopAnswer
[2,two] Right, with 3 dice... so what number did you really get? @LoopAnswer
[3,three] What are the odds... #EmoteSad @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[3]
[4,four] Meh... @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[4]
[5,five] Meh... @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[5]
[6,six] Six it is @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[6]
[7,seven] Lucky seven! Lucky for you, that is... @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[7]
[8,eight] Only 8... lucky you @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[8]
[9,nine] That's not bad @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[9]
[10,ten] 10 is a nice round number, a bit low though @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[10]
[11,eleven] I'm slightly disappointed #EmoteWink @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[11]
[12,twelve] That'll do #PetName, that'll do #Smile @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[12]
[13,thirteen] Lucky 13 #Smile @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[13]
[14,fourteen] That's not too bad @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[14]
[15,fifteen] That's not bad, I'm happy #Smile @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[15]
[16,sixteen] Sweet sixteen #Smile @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[16]
[17,seventeen] Oh yeah #Laugh @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[17]
[18,eighteen] This is going to take a while #Laugh @SetVar[pthevMod2Aedges]=[18]
@DifferentAnswer Seriously #SubName, what number?
Let's @RT(do this,get started,get to it,begin,have it then) #Smile @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Goto,need break)

Let's do some more edging
Do you have 3 dice ready?
[yes] Let's see how lucky you are today... @Goto(throw three dice)
[no] @NullResponse
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Oh...
But you're going to get them for me right away, right?
[ready] Let's see how lucky you are today... @Goto(throw three dice)
[yes,of course,certainly,as you wish] Good, let me know when you're ready @LoopAnswer
[no] What, you don't like edging anymore all of a sudden? @DommeLevelUp @MoodDown
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Maybe you'd prefer hurting yourself... @CBT
@NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_PunishmentLight_NotStroking.txt)
Make sure you have 3 dice next time 
Remember, you can also use websites like random.org/dice
