@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvMod45B)
I'm going to let you rest a few seconds now @SetFlag(pvMod45A)
You're going to need each and every one of them #Grin
You know why?
Because we're going to play a little game
Who doesn't like to play games, right? @ResponseYes(ILikeGames)
I'm going to show you some pictures
Nice ones #Smile
And you're going to stroke for them
10 for the first one, 20 for the second, 30 for the third... and so on
But all pictures are up for the same amount of time, so you'll be stroking faster and faster
The game ends when you get to the edge
Then we'll see how many pictures you 'completed' @SetVar[pvMod16Punches]=[10]
@BallTorture Now you might ask, "what am I playing <i>for</i>?" @Goto(play for balls)
Try to get a good score, #PetName #Smile @Goto(play for score)
(play for balls)
Well, you play to avoid getting your #Balls busted, of course
You will start with 10 punches to your #Balls
And with every new picture you see, the number of punches is lowered by 1
So the longer you can keep the edge at bay, the better for your #Balls #Smile
(play for score)
Okay, here we go @SetVar[pvMod16HMP]=[0] @LockImages @EdgeMode(Goto,how many pictures)

@NullResponse @If[pvMod16Punches]=[1]Then(just one)
@BallTorture Your #Balls are going to be sorry for your lack of self control #Grin @Goto(go ahead and smack)
That's a bit disappointing, I guess you should practice #JerkingOff more #EmoteWink
@End
(go ahead and smack)
Go ahead and smack your #Balls @ShowVar[pvMod16Punches] times, #PetName
[done] Good boy #Smile
@AcceptAnswer Good boy #Smile
Just try a little harder next time
And your #Balls might not feel so sore afterwards #EmoteWink
@End
(all gone)
That's pretty impressive, #SubName
@BallTorture No ball busting this time
You're getting pretty good at staying away from the edge #Smile
@End
(just one)
Not bad, #PetName
@BallTorture Just the one good smack to your #Balls then @Goto(one good smack)
You're getting pretty good at staying away from the edge #Smile
@End
(one good smack)
Do it now, and make it hurt!
[done] Good boy #Smile
@AcceptAnswer Good boy #Smile
When you do your best, you get rewarded, #Name
Well, at least you don't get punished so much #Laugh
@End
(pvMod45A)
Take a moment to recover from that last edge, #Name @DeleteFlag(pvMod45A)
Breath in a deep breath... @SetFlag(pvMod45B)
And breathe out slowly
Admire my body
Or admire <i>her</i> body @ShowTaggedImage @TagSoloF
I don't mind if you look at other women, #Name
In fact, I show you lots of pictures of other women myself, don't I?
You'd do it anyway you pervert, so it's best if I choose the pictures #Smile
I want you to take the palm of your hand, and use it to rub the head of your #Cock
Don't stroke, #Name
Your fingers should be spread out so you can't grab the shaft
Twist your wrist to palm your #Cock in a circling motion
You can rub your #Balls with your other hand if you want to @Wait(#Random(10,30))
Now grab that #Cock and give me 10 full strokes, #Name @EdgeMode(Goto,palming edge)
And then...
Go back to palming slowly with your fingers spread out @Wait(#Random(10,30))
Is this driving you crazy?
I hope it is #Grin
Grab that #Cock and give me 20 fast full strokes
Come on, faster #Name
And go back to palming again... fingers spread out... just touching the head @Wait(#Random(10,30))
Give me some long, full strokes
Grab the shaft tight and squeeze it as you stroke...
Mmm it feels good to grab it and stroke after all that palming, right? #Smile
#StrokeFaster
Hands off! @EdgeMode(Normal)
Oooh how frustrating #Laugh
Were you hoping I'd let you build up to a nice long edge?
[yes] Not this time, #PetName
[no] I guess you were frustrated enough already #Laugh
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Although I could change my mind about that, of course... @Chance40(changed mind)
Nope #Laugh
@End
(changed mind)
Making you squirm is just so much fun...
#Edge @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade
@End
(palming edge)
You were not supposed to edge from that, #PetName
I guess you're pretty sensitive and achy right now #Giggles
Well, let's use that against you #Grin
#Edge @EdgeHold @MultipleEdges(3,6,50)
#LetTheEdgeFade

(pvMod45B)
That thing between your legs gets so sensitive when you do that, doesn't it? @DeleteFlag(pvMod45B)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Tease the tip of your #Cock
Do it very gently, feel how sensitive it is
How much it's aching for more
It wants to be kept on the edge so fucking much, doesn't it?
[yes] Yes it does #Grin
[no] You know that's not true, #PetName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
You know that poor #Cock is practically begging for it
Let's give it what it wants then, shall we?
