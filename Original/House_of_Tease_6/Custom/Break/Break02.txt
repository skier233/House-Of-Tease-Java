Here's what I want you to do, #Name
(draw again)
Go find a piece of paper and a pen or pencil or whatever
You're going to make a drawing! #Smile
I want you to draw yourself a you kneel at my feet
It doesn't have to be a great work of art, stick figures are fine
As long as you clearly draw both of us, me standing and you kneeling before me
Now get started, just let me know when you're ready
[ready,done,finished] Good #Smile
@DifferentAnswer Just let me know when you're ready
I want you to keep that drawing somewhere safe @SetFlag(pvBreak02Drawing)
Or if you can, pin it to your wall so you can see it every day #Smile

Do you still have that drawing you made of you kneeling before me?
[yes] Good boy #Smile
[no] Oh... @MoodDown @DeleteFlag(pvBreak02Drawing) @Goto(draw again)
@DifferentAnswer Do you have it yes or no?
I want you to make another drawing for me
Like last time, you should draw both of us
But this time I'll leave it up to you in what position or scenario
I', sure you can think of something, #PetName
Now get started, just let me know when you're ready
[ready,done,finished] Good #Smile
@DifferentAnswer Just let me know when you're ready
Keep it with the other drawing @SetFlag(pvBreak02Drawings) @DeleteFlag(pvBreak02Drawing)
It's staring to looke like a collection, #Name #EmoteHappy
@End
(pvBreak02Drawings)
I want you to make another drawing for your collection
It should picture me and you, in a scenario of your choosing
It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, #PetName
Now get started, just let me know when you're ready
[ready,done,finished] Good boy
@DifferentAnswer Just let me know when you're ready
Just keep it with the other pictures #Smile
