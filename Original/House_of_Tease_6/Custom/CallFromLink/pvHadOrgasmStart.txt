So... you had an orgasm without my permission?
[yes]  @RT(Hmm,Tsk tsk,Ooohh,Well,My my)
[no] Oh, I... must have misunderstood then @Goto(must have misunderstood)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo

@Flag(pvOrgasmControl) @NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_OrgasmControlReset.txt)
I don't like it when you cum without my permission, #SubName @CheckFlag(pthevCompleteControlYES)
At least decided to do the right thing and told me
So obviously you understand you've made a mistake
And I must say, that makes me very happy #Smile @MoodUp
It shows me that you are willing to be a better sub for me
So #SubName...
What if from now on, you give me control over all your masturbation habits
Not just when you come to me for a session
I want to know that you #JerkOff <i>only</i> when I say you can
Are you willing to do that?
[yes] Hmm... that's a good #PetName @DeleteFlag(pthevCompleteControlNO) @SetFlag(pthevCompleteControlYES)
[no] Okay... but then there's also no point in telling me you've been #JerkingOff #SubName @Goto(must have misunderstood)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
That's how deep you've fallen into my control #Smile
From now on, your #Cock fully and truly belongs to me
You are not allowed to touch it unless you have my permission
It may be difficult sometimes, but #SubName...
It's worth it #Smile
Because more and more you are becoming what you truly are
A submissive who will do anything that I ask
(must have misunderstood)
#StartStroking @StartStroking

@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pthevLongDenialActive)
You're a bad #PetName
And you know what happens when you are bad, don't you?
You get punished... @Interrupt(pvInt_Punishment)

@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLDASecondWeek)
Especially since you were not supposed to cum at all this week
Apparently you were not ready for it
I should have known... #EmoteSad
Maybe we should try that again some other day
When you've learned what it means to <i>truly</i> submit
For now, a punishment will have to do @Interrupt(pvInt_Punishment)

(pvLDASecondWeek)
I guess two weeks of denial was just too much to ask
I should have known, really
So some the blame is on me, I guess
<i>I</i> am the one who owns <i>you</i> after all
And you can't deny a masturbation junkie the one thing he loves
I should have known that
So I'm not mad, #SubName
Disappointed, yes, but not angry
I'm not even going to punish you @Interrupt(pvIn_General)
@End
