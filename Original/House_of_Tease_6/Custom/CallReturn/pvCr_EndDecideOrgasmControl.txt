(Denial Game)
So nice to have an orgasm once in a while, isn't it?
But let's not make it a habit, #Name
In fact, consider yourself denied for the foreseeable future
The first question that enters your mind is probably "for how long?"
Well, at the end of our next session we'll play a little game to find out @RestrictOrgasm(4 weeks) @SetFlag(pvOrgasmControl) @SetFlag(pvOCGame)
It might be only a few days... but it might be a fair bit longer too
Like I said, we'll see next time, but let me give you a quick rundown of the rules
I will pick a number between 3 and 15
That number will be your initial number of days of denial
You get to guess what the number is
If you guess the right number or higher... then you get the number of days you chose
But If you guess too low... I add 1 to the initial number
And then you get to guess again the next day, a number between 4 and 16 #Grin
So you can see the dilemma...
If you choose a high number, you have to suffer denial for a long time
So you can try to reduce your suffering by going for a lower number
But each time you do you risk increasing the minimum by 1...
And who knows, maybe you'll get really lucky and it's only 3 days! #Smile
I'll leave you to think it over now, #PetName

(Roll The Dice)
I'm having a lot of fun deciding when you get to cum
But I want to try something a little bit different the next few weeks
I'm not going to be the one deciding your fate
A roll of the dice will...
Here's what I'm going to do, #Name
I'm going to throw the dice to decide the number of days until you get a chance of orgasm
If you're lucky I'll throw a 1, which means you get a chance tomorrow
But it could also be 6, meaning almost a week before you get a chance to cum
And on that day you either cum or you don't, after which I throw the dice again #Smile @SetVar[OCDiceThrows]=[1] @RestrictOrgasm(4 weeks)
If you can't make it on that day, you will have missed your chance @SetFlag(pvOCRollDice) @SetFlag(pvOrgasmControl)
So here we go for the first throw... @Goto(one,two,three,four,five,six)
(one)
It's 1...
Okay, so I guess you'll get another chance tomorrow #Smile
@NullResponse @SetVar[pvOCDice]=[1] @SetDate(pvOCDiceMin,12 hours) @SetDate(pvOCDiceMax,36 hours)
@End
(two)
It's a 2
That means the day after tomorrow is the next chance you get
@NullResponse @SetVar[pvOCDice]=[2] @SetDate(pvOCDiceMin,36 hours) @SetDate(pvOCDiceMax,60 hours)
@End
(three)
It's 3
So 2 days of denial before you get another chance
@NullResponse @SetVar[pvOCDice]=[3] @SetDate(pvOCDiceMin,60 hours) @SetDate(pvOCDiceMax,84 hours)
@End
(four)
It's 4
So 3 days of denial before you get another chance
@NullResponse @SetVar[pvOCDice]=[4] @SetDate(pvOCDiceMin,84 hours) @SetDate(pvOCDiceMax,108 hours)
@End
(five)
It's 5
So 4 days of denial before you get another chance
@NullResponse @SetVar[pvOCDice]=[5] @SetDate(pvOCDiceMin,108 hours) @SetDate(pvOCDiceMax,132 hours)
@End
(six)
It's 6
So 5 days of denial before you get another chance
@NullResponse @SetVar[pvOCDice]=[6] @SetDate(pvOCDiceMin,132 hours) @SetDate(pvOCDiceMax,156 hours)
