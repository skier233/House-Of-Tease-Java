What if I don't let you cum at all anymore for a very long time
But still make you edge every day over and over again
I wonder if your body would simply forget how to climax
And then you'd be unable to cum even if I told you to cum...
That would be my ultimate goal, #PetName
Permanent Orgasm Denial
I suppose that will always remain a dream #Smile

In a way, and edge is always a disappointment, isn't it?
Even if you know it's only an edge and you're not going to get to cum
I bet there's always a little glimmer of hope in your mind
Like a tiny little voice telling you: Maybe this time she'll let me cum
And then I tell you to stop again and get away from the edge...
That the way I am, always crushing your hopes in so many little ways... #Grin

I shouldn't be so kind as to let you edge when you want to... being way too lenient
The problem with edging, #SubName...
Is that although it does make you ache like crazy... 
It also always leads to you taking you hand off your #Cock
Sometimes I think I shouldn't even let you edge at all anymore
Just endless stroking: no edges, no orgasm
But... that would be too cruel, even for me #EmoteWink

You're so desperate for release now, aren't you?
Maybe I should just let you cum, like right now...
Would you like to cum right now?
[yes] Mmmm yes I thought you might say that...
[no] I suppose we can draw this out a little longer @Goto(not another edge)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
But remember, you can only cum if you have my permission
And I'm going to let you cum now, but you'll have to do a few edges first...

I lied, I'm not going to let you cum right now #Smile
But you didn't actually think I would, right?

I hope you're not going to regret your decision, #PetName #Grin

So close to cumming now... I bet I could push you over the edge in seconds now
But I'm not done with you yet, #PetName
