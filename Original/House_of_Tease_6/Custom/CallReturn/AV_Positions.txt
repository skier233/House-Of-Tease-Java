Hey #SubName @SetVar[AV_PosKneelNumber]=[0] 
We are doing this for some time now... @SetVar[AV_PosPoints]=[0] 
And I want to bring this to the next level
Being a slave means more than jerking your cock for me every time you're aroused. 
Being a slave means devoting yourself to an ideal, and being MY slave means devoting yourself to being the ideal slave. 
One who rises every morning thinking of me and goes to sleep each night thinking of me. 
One who focuses on the things that can be done to please me, learning my likes and dislikes, trying to make himself useful to me. 
So I will begin with a little training
Sessions affirmations and mantras for you.
Because I know how the male mind works, 
my words will burn themselves into your mind.
Follow the instructions and you'll be on your way to being a good little slave boy. 
you're gonna work on some slave positions
I will show you a position (kneel or stand)
You need to memorize this position for future sessions
Anytime in the session when you hear a specific sound
you must go to this position immediately
If you get the correct position fast, you got points.
If not, you lose points.
from time to time, I can change the position, for you do not get spoiled 
understood?
[yes] Good 
[no] You will when we start
