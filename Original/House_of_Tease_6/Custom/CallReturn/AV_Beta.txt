#StopStroking @StopStroking
There's something I'd like to know about you...
I love that you're doing all this for me
The stroking, the edging, following commands...
But as someone with a dominant personality it puzzles me
Why do you do this...
Now, the way I see it some people are Alphas and others betas
Obviously, I'm an Alpha #Smile
But just because you like being submissive doesn't necessarily mean you are a beta...
You could be an Alpha who just needs a break from being in control now and then
Although it would make more sense if you <i>were</i> a beta... 
Whose only purpose in life is to serve as amusement for us Alphas #Smile
So what do you think, are you an Alpha or a beta?
[alpha] Oh really? @SetFlag(pvAlpha) @Goto(am an alpha)
[beta] I thought so #Smile @SetFlag(pvBeta)
@DifferentAnswer Are you an Alpha or a beta?
At least it makes some things in life simple, right? @SetFlag(AV_Beta)
I mean, you don't have to think about wether you could get a girl like me
@Flag(pvHasPartner) Not as a knock on @Var[pthevNamePartner] of course, I'm sure she's lovely
@Flag(pvHasPartner) You're lucky someone's interested in you at all...
That doesn't mean you can't dream and drool over hot girls
And just because you're not a <i>real</i> man doesn't mean you can't please a woman
You just have to make a little bit more of an effort #Smile
@End
(am an alpha)
Well, I'd be happy to bring you down a peg #Laugh
Even if it's just for a few precious moments
It can be good for Alpha males like yourself to know their place
I mean, you're still a <i>guy</i>, which puts you below me by default #Smile
