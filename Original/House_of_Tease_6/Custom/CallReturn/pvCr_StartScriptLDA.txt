So... @SetFlag(pvLDC6)
This week without orgasms...
You <i>have</i> still been able to keep yourself from cumming, right?
[yes] Good
[no] @NullResponse @Goto(LDA had an orgasm)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
I was wondering
Has it been getting easier or more harder?
[easier] I thought so #Laugh
[harder] Really? I'm surprised...
@DifferentAnswer Easier of harder, #Name?
Anyway, it's not long now...
You must be anxious to get to the end
Almost there, #PetName #Smile

(day five)
@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLDC5,no lines)
It is now what, day 5 of this 'week of denial'? @SetFlag(pvLDC5)
You're doing great, #Name #EmoteHappy

(day three)
@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLDC3,no lines)
You might be wondering if this week of tease and denial @SetFlag(pvLDC3)
Is going to get any easier as it progresses...
I honestly don't know, #PetName
I can't imagine going without orgasms for a week #Laugh
But you're going to do it for me
And at the end, you can tell me #Smile
@End
(day two)
@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLDC2,no lines)
So tell me, #Name... @SetFlag(pvLDC2)
Have you been a good #PetName since last time?
[yes] I knew you wouldn't let me down #Smile
[no] Oh... @Goto(LDA had an orgasm)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
I'm sure you'll make it all the way to the end of the week
@End
(day one)
@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLDC1,no lines)
We've only just started your orgasm-less week @SetFlag(pvLDC1)
So I'm going to assume I don't have to ask you if you've been good #Smile

@NullResponse @Goto(SW1,SW2,SW3,SW4,SW5,SW6,SW7,SW8,SW9)
(SW1)
I can't even begin to imagine how horny you must be now
More than a week without orgasm...
Sounds like an eternity to me
@End
(SW2)
It's been over a week since you came, #Name
I hope you're not secretly #JerkingOff and not telling me...
You would tell me if you had an orgasm, right?
[yes,sure,of course,always] Stupid question, I know...
[no] Oh... well if it makes you happy to lie to me @MoodWorst
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
It's a lot more fun if you're being honest with me
@End
(SW3)
Another day without orgasm has passed...
You must be feeling pretty desperate by now #Grin

(SW6)
@RT(I would expect,It would seem to me), #Name...
That after being @RT(not allowed to cum,denied) for @RT(sometime,a while), at some point
You would be tempted to take that #Cock in your hand
And @RT(stroke,jerk) yourself to orgasm
Have you felt that temptation in the past week?
[yes] It must be @RT(tough,hard,difficult), #SubName
[no] Wow, that's @RT(incredible,amazing,great) @Goto(it is that easy)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
But so far you've managed to control yourself, right?
[yes] Good #PetName
[no] Oh... @Goto(LDA had an orgasm)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
It's worth the wait, I promise #Smile
@End
(it is that easy)
I guess we could easily add a couple more weeks then #EmoteWink
@End
(SW7)
I've kept you denied for so long now
Precum must be leaking from that #Cock all day and all night #Giggles
You <i>have</i> been able to control yourself since last time, right?
[yes] Good
[no] Oh... @Goto(LDA had an orgasm)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
#GeneralTime I'm going to see if I can trip you up #Grin
@End
(SW8)
The longer you are denied, the easier it gets, right #PetName?
[yes] That's what I thought and I'm glad you agree, 'cause...
[no] That's too bad, because I like this arrangement a lot
@AcceptAnswer It <i>should</i> get easier
I'm thinking of making it a <i>month</i> of denial #Grin
And we could go even longer than that, who knows!
@End
(SW9)
You know that old saying about the journey and the destination?
In this case, your 2 weeks of being denied...
You might think it <i>is</i> about the destination
That mind-blowing orgasm at the end
But it isn't, #SubName
Not really
You might find that, at the end of this journey
You will want to keep going
Because the truth is...
That erotic buzz you constantly feel when you're being teased and denied
It feels <i>good</i> #Grin

----- LDA HAD AN ORGASM -----------

(LDA had an orgasm)
Let's be clear about this, #SubName
Are you telling me that you had an orgasm without my permission?
[yes] @RT(Dammit,Fuck), #PetName @DeleteFlag(pvHAA) @Goto(LDA made a mistake)
[no] I must have misunderstood then...
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Okay, let's just move on...
@End

I gave you an instruction and you failed miserably @MoodWorst
If you can't take it, then so be it
But I'm still going to punish you for it
@NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_Punishment.txt)
@NullResponse
@End
(pvLDASecondWeek)
But I guess two weeks of denial was just too much to ask @MoodDown
I should have known, really
So some of the blame is on me, I guess
<i>I</i> am the one who owns <i>you</i> after all
And you can't deny a masturbation junkie the one thing he loves
I should have known that
So I'm not mad, #SubName
Disappointed, yes, but not angry
I'm not even going to punish you
