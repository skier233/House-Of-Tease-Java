Down on your knees
I want you to hold the cane between your teeth
Hands behind your back @Timeout(18,hands behind back)

You really have it learn to listen to me @Wait(12)

I think you're ready for your punishment now
Take the cane out of your mouth 
Oh, and wipe it clean in case you drooled all over it

I want you to bend over your chair, go get one if you need to @Wait(6)
Place your hands on the seat
You will match every swish and crack of the cane you hear
Each time you will hit your ass as hard as you can
I want red stripes across your skin, #Name @SetFlag(pthevCaneExplained)
And I want you to count them out loud @Goto(top caning)
(pthevCaneExplained)
Get into the position #Name, hands on your chair
Don't forget to count out loud, and don't hold back #SubName
Remember that you could never strike as hard as I would

(corner)
In a moment I want you go a corner of your room
Make sure your back is turned to your computer
And then I want you to kneel down
Your nose should almost touch the wall
And no stroking, #PetName, hands off your #Cock
When I think it's enough I'm going to ring a bell
So make sure you can hear me
Understood?
[yes] Good @Goto(go now)
[no] It's very simple #PetName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
You are going to kneel with your nose to the wall
You can come back when you here this bell @PlayAudio[PtheV\bell.mp3]

You're going to need your leather belt, you need a good punishment
Do you have it?
[yes,got it,ready] Good
[no] Go get it then, tell me when you're ready @LoopAnswer
[not possible,impossible,can't] *Sigh* @Goto(without implements)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Get on your knees and give your ass 30 smacks with the belt
After every 10 smacks, I want you to type "Thank you #DomHonorific"
And I want your #Ass to look nice and red
Okay #PetName, do it!
[thank you] Good, the next 10 now
@DifferentAnswer What did I tell you to say?
Tell me, #SubName
[thank you] Okay, 10 more smacks
@DifferentAnswer What did I tell you to say?
I'm waiting
[thank you] Well done, you can put away the belt for now
@DifferentAnswer No, try again #SubName
Your ass must be all red and glowing now
You can get off your knees now, by the way @Goto(punishment ending)

Spread your knees a little further apart
Lower your head so your chin almost touches your chest @CBTCock
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade @Chance80(skip safeword talk)
Only using the safeword can get you out of this mess, #SubName
But I'd be a little disappointed if you used it
And I think you would too
