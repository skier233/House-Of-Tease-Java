So, time to decide for how long you'll stay denied, #PetName #Grin @SetFlag(pvOCGameActive)
I'm going to pick a random number between 3 and 15...
And you're going to guess what it is
If you guess the right number or higher, than that's the number of days you get
If you guess too low, I add 1 too the original number and you get to guess again tomorrow
Oh right, I forgot to mention last time: you have to guess every day
If you skip day, I'll just add 1 to the total again #Smile
Okay here we go, let me pick a number...
