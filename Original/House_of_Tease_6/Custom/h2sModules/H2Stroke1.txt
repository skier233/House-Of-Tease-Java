I hope you dont mind that she will join us today #EmoteLaugh @AddContact1
Look whos here
@Contact1 Hello #ShortName!
@Contact1 Hi #SubName
@Contact1 #ShortName told me many things about you #SubName #Grin
@Contact1 She said that you are able to stroke your #Cock for hours #EmoteMoan
Did I really tell you that #Contact1? #EmoteHer
@Contact1 YES you did #ShortName #EmoteLaugh
@Contact1 Anyway I was so aroused in getting the chance to test you on my own #PetName #EmoteBreath
@Contact1 And now we are both here. #EmoteMoan
@Contact1 Its kind of weird
@Contact1 What about some warming up?
@Contact1 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(3, 5)
@Contact1 I never did that before.
@Contact1 When #ShortName told me about you, I couldnt get you out of my mind.
@Contact1 I was thinking about you nearly every day
@Contact1 Just the thought of making you edge, over and over again, gets me totally wet
@Contact1 Thinking of you
@Contact1 stroking your hard #Cock at full speed for me
@Contact1 moaning my name out loud, while stroking for me in your chair
@Contact1 #SubName the imagination of your dripping #Cock makes me vibrating here
@Contact1 I am all soaking wet, so lets get to the funny part @SetFlag(Contact1_unit)
Looks like its getting funny, so i am sneaking outta here @RemoveDomme
@Contact1 #SubName are you still dressed?
[yes] @Contact1 this will cost you at least 10 edges extra @SetVar[EdgesAdd]=[10] @Goto(Sub_undress)
[no] @Contact1 Thats a good boy!!! So we can move on
@DifferentAnswer @Contact1 What should i do with this answer?
@Contact1 So please get in wanking position and
@Contact1 Tell me when you are ready to get started!
@Contact1 so lets start @Goto(Sub_hard)
(Contact1_unit)
@NullResponse @AddContact1
Hello again #Contact1
Nice to have you back
@Contact1 Thx #ShortName
@Contact1 I really enjoyed my last lesson with #SubName
@Contact1 He did a pretty good job :-)
Thats good to hear #Contact1, hope you will have lots of fun today with him
Will take me a while to get back here, so you have nearly the whole day with him #Lol
@Contact1 Oh that sounds good to me #ShortName
@Contact1 I havent planned anything else, than making #PetName edge #EmoteLaugh
Thats a great idea, so i am already out of here, bye bye @RemoveDomme
@Contact1 Speaking of edges
@Contact1 For warmup give me some edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(4, 15)
@Contact1 I am sure we will have fun again @SetFlag(Contact1_unit1)
@Contact1 #SubName are you still dressed?
[yes] @Contact1 this will cost you at least 10 edges extra @SetVar[EdgesAdd]=[10] @Goto(Sub_undress)
[no] @Contact1 Thats a good boy!!! So we can move on
@DifferentAnswer @Contact1 What should i do with this answer?
@Contact1 So please get in wanking position
@Contact1 Tell me when you are ready to get started!
[ready,ok,yes] @Contact1 so lets start @Goto(Sub_hard)
(Contact1_unit1)
@NullResponse @AddContact1
Hey #Contact1, nice to see you
How are you today?
@Contact1 Thank #ShortName, everything is fine.
@Contact1 And what about you?
Also fine, and thank you, that you take care of #SubName again.
I have a lot of things to get done, so i will just fly and leave you all alone.
We will chat later, when i get back. See you.
@Contact1 Ok #ShortName, see you later
@RemoveDomme
@Contact1 Now we are all alone again #SubName.
@Contact1 I really enjoy making you squirm and ache for me #PetName
@Contact1 Now i understand what #ShortName likes that much on you.
@Contact1 It is really funny to see your #Cock #Ache.
@Contact1 But as you know, to get an aching #Cock, you need to #Stroke a lot.
@Contact1 And i am sure you that you already realised, that this is going to happen right now #Smile
@Contact1 The only things that needs to be cleared are
@Contact1 Naked ? 
[no] @Contact1 You know what that means, dont you? 20 edges extra @SetVar[EdgesAdd]=[20]
[yes] @Contact1 Well prepared #PetName
@DifferentAnswer try again
@Contact1 And the second thing is
@Contact1 Hard ?
[no] @Contact1 Do i really need to tell you again? Another 20 edges extra @Goto(Sub_hard)
[yes] @Contact1 Well prepared #PetName
@DifferentAnswer Try again
@Contact1 I think we can get things going now @Wait(30)
@NullResponse @Goto(Sub_decision)
(Sub_undress)
@Contact1 Ok then, lets get rid of this useless clothes.
@Contact1 I want you bare naked and ready to serve.
@Contact1 I hope i dont need to tell you that you just have 1 minute to be ready @Wait(40)
@Contact1 AWWW too bad, you didnt make it in time, which gives another 20 edges extra @ChangeVar[EdgesAdd]=[EdgesAdd]+[20]
@Contact1 Now you should be naked and sitting in your chair.
(Sub_hard)
@Contact1 but is your cock hard already ?
[yes] @Contact1 OK then stand up and present your #Cock to me now and be ready to worship me @Goto(Sub_decision)
[no] @Contact1 this brings up another 20 edges extra
@DifferentAnswer @Contact1 What should i do with this answer? @LoopAnswer
(EdgesAdd)
@Contact1 Seems you picked up some extra work @ChangeVar[EdgesAdd]=[EdgesAdd]+[20]
@Contact1 Fine #EmoteLaugh
@Contact1 Do you need some help to get hard?
[yes] @NullResponse @Goto(Sub_help)
[no] @NullResponse @Goto(Sub_decision)
@DifferentAnswer Try again
(Sub_help)
@Contact1 I hope this video will help to get your #Cock hard
@PlayVideo
@Contact1 I expect that you are hard now so
@Contact1 Tell me when you are ready to get to serious stroking!
[ready,ok,yes] @Contact1 Ok then lets get to work @Goto(Sub_decision)
[no] @Contact1 Then you get another chance @Goto(Sub_help)
@DifferentAnswer @Contact1 ???
(Sub_decision)
@Contact1 So what are we going to do today #SubName?
@Contact1 What if I let decide YOU ?
@Contact1 I think I will give you 3 options
@Contact1 Some edges?
@Contact1 A few ruined orgasms?
@Contact1 Or CBT and ballbusting?
@Contact1 So whats your favourite?
[edges, 1] @Contact1 @Goto(Sub_edges)
[ruin, 2] @Contact1 @Goto(Sub_ruin)
[CBT, 3] @Contact1 @Goto(Sub_cbt)
@DifferentAnswer Thats not what I wanted to hear, try again
(Sub_edges)
@Contact1 Thats what I like on you #SubName
@Contact1 Your unbroken will to serve me with all that edges
@Contact1 So lets find out what we have to deal with :-)
@Contact1 For this purpose I have brought a special dice #Lol
@Contact1 A 20-sided dice, which I am going to use for this
@NullResponse @SetVar[Sub_EdgeGoal]=[#Random(1,20)]
@Contact1 The dice tells me @ShowVar[Sub_EdgeGoal]
@Contact1 So far, so good
@Contact1 And now let the fate decide the multiplier for us #Lol
@NullResponse @If[Sub_EdgeGoal]<=[5]Then(Change_var)
@Contact1 Its not really what I wanted, but I have to deal with it @Goto(ExtraEdges)
(Change_var)
@ChangeVar[Sub_EdgeGoal]=[Sub_EdgeGoal]*[#Random(2,3)]
@Contact1 So fate decided
@Contact1 that you have to do @ShowVar[Sub_EdgeGoal] edges for me tonight #PetName
(ExtraEdges)
@Contact1 Lets have a look, if you had some extra edges :-)
@Contact1 @ShowVar[EdgesAdd]
@Contact1 As you remember, you were not really prepared and picked up some extra edges
@NullResponse @ChangeVar[Sub_EdgeGoal]=[Sub_EdgeGoal]+[EdgesAdd]
@Contact1 So we end up with @ShowVar[Sub_EdgeGoal] in total for #GeneralTime
@Contact1 Sounds good to me #SubName
@Contact1 But what about you?
[its ok, good, fine] @Contact1 Just what I have thought :-) @Goto(Start_Session)
[not good, too much, no good, dont like, no] @Contact1 Did i really hear that?
@DifferentAnswer ...
@Contact1 So you think thats too much for you?
@Contact1 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(2, 10)
@Contact1 Hmmm in fact that you dont want to do that much edges for me, i think it is necessary to explain you, who makes the rules here.
@Contact1 And that you have to learn it from the beginning, i will not be that easy on you this time
@NullResponse @SetVar[Sub_EdgesAdd]=[#Random(10, 15)]
@Contact1 I decided that i increase your edge-account with @ShowVar[Sub_EdgesAdd] edges
@NullResponse @ChangeVar[Sub_EdgeGoal]=[Sub_EdgeGoal]+[Sub_EdgesAdd]
@Contact1 Next time i think i will not be that kind to you !
@Contact1 Which means you have to do @ShowVar[Sub_EdgeGoal] edges for me now!
@Contact1 And be sure that you will do them all!
@Contact1 So you better think of your answers before!
(Start_Session)
@Contact1 Seems we have some serious work to do for YOU #Grin
@Contact1 What are we waiting for?
@Contact1 I'm going to show you some pictures I found online
@NullResponse @SetVar[Edge_Count]=[0]
@Contact1 And when I think I have a really good one
@Contact1 I'll let you edge to it #Grin
