Look at that flame flickering, #Name @TempFlag(pvLinkWax01A)
Is there enough molten wax for us to use?
[yes] Then let's not waste it
[no] No problem, we have time #Smile @Goto(we have time)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Sit back a little bit
@Flag(pvKneeling) You can get off your knees now @DeleteFlag(pvKneeling)
I'm sure I don't have to tell you this, but be careful, #SubName
It's still an open flame you have there...
@Flag(pvBallsTied) Your #Balls are so nicely tied up and exposed #Grin @Goto(balls tied)
@Flag(pthevShoelace) @NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_TieMyBalls.txt)
(balls tied)
Pick up that candle, #PetName @CustomMode(#pvDontWantTo,Goto,do not want)
I want you to drip a few drops on your #Balls
Just a few drops...
Feel it burn on your skin, #PetName
Put down the candle for a moment
Give me 25 quick strokes to make sure your #Cock is still hard @Wait(10)
I don't know if that was really necessary, actually
Maybe you got even harder from the wax dripping on those tender #Balls
Pick up the candle and drip some wax on your chest
Start with the area around your nipples, then make a trail down to your belly
It's like I'm branding you, #Name
Burning my name into your skin the way my control is burnt into your mind
The wax is an affirmation of my ownership of you
And my ownership of your #Cock
Drip some wax on the shaft, #PetName @Wait(10)
And a couple more on your #Balls too @Wait(10)
Good boy
Is there any doubt left that you're completely mine? #Smile
Put away the candle, but keep it burning @CustomMode(#pvDontWantTo,Normal)
You never know, we might need it later on... @Wait(15)
Ready to continue, #SubName?
[ready,yes] Good
[no] Let me know when you are ready
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you are ready
Those little patches of wax are marks of your submission to me, #PetName
Wear them proudly while they last #Smile

(do not want)
Alright, put down the candle, #SubName @MoodDown
It's always disappointing when you down follow through of stuff
But in this case, I'm not going to punish you for it
@End
(we have time)
And there are so many ways to keep your #Balls burning with ache #Grin
@End
(pvLinkWax01A)
Look at those tiny dried patches of wax on your skin
Or maybe all that remains is spots of red skin
Marks of where I touched you with my fingertips
Showing you how much you belong to me
