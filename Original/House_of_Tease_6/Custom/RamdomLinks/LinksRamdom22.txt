I used you in so many exciting ways 
and did things to you you'd never even thought of before I did them to you... 
and you loved every minute of it too. 
It really was a work of erotic art that we created together.
Hmmm... I think you're ready for a little bit more of the wand now though.
Wouldn't you agree?  @ResponseYes(ILoveBeingControlled) @ResponseNo(AV_NoNeutral)

Your poor balls! 
Probably backed up with so much sperm. 
I bet your little tadpoles are sprouting legs at this point!
So, it seems obvious that the aching feeling in your testicles is just a serve case of blue balls.
#Lol
No shooting off just yet!
Look at your cock, bobbing up and down.
I even see some precum starting to dribble!
But we need to take our time and really get you ready to explode
that way your body will let as much of it out as possible.

Tell me, my sweet boy, how do you enjoy this soft torture? @ResponseYes(ILoveBeingControlled) @ResponseNo(AV_NoNeutral) 
Is it to your taste? Or is it not enough? 
I'm sure, if we kept going long enough, you would eventually cum.
But where is the fun in that?
I want to satisfy myself just as much as I want to play with you.
Awww, poor baby. Is it really that difficult to resist me?

I keep getting distracted.
I wanted to talk about training, and what you'll be doing for me, and all that.
There will be lots of worship, because I'm a goddess, and your Mistress deserves the best, doesn't she?  @ResponseYes(AV_YesGood) @ResponseNo(AV_NoBad) 
Don't worry about being inexperienced, I'll tell you exactly what to do, darling. 
If I tell you to give me a kiss, you give me a kiss. 
Make it the best, most passionate kiss you've ever given.
I might tell you to kiss my foot or my nipple.
Whatever it is, you'll do it without question, won't you dear?  @ResponseYes(AV_YesGood) @ResponseNo(AV_NoBad) 
Of course you will. 
It's what a good slave does, and I can already tell you're going to be the best 
Don't look so down! It'll be fun!
