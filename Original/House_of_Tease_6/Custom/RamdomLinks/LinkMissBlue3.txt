At least all this stroking and edging is good for your sexual endurance
I'd hope so anyway #Smile
So the next time you actually have sex 
Whenever that might be #EmoteWink
You have the stamina to please your partner
Just remember that you have me to thank for that, in part at least
You're welcome, #PetName

I wonder what goes on in your mind sometimes, #SubName
I know some of it
I know the pure arousal that percolates up from your #Balls
Creeping upward through your veins and infiltrating your brain
I know the feelings of obedience that drive you to obey my commands
But I wonder how far you're really willing to go...
What dark corners of that mind of yours we haven't explored yet
The corners that you barely want to admit to yourself exist
Maybe we'll explore them someday
But for now...

Hey #PetName...
Imagine if I could actually take you in as a servant
You'd live with me, nobody else would need to see you
I could use you as I saw fit...
You'd have to do chores, obviously
I'd make you mop the floor naked
I could whip you as often as I wanted
And if I needed an orgasm...
Well that's what servants mouths are for, aren't they #Laugh
It would be like in the ancient world, when they actually had slavery
Those were truly the days, #SubName #Laugh
Unfortunately, we live in the modern era #EmoteSad
Which has it's own advantages of course
Such as having a #PetName glued to a screen, obeying every command #EmoteHappy
For example...

Hey, #SubName
I heard this story the other day about a friend of a friend
She found out her husband had been cheating on her @CheckFlag(pthevLink11A)
There was a big scene and he left her for his girlfriend
(but apparently)
But apparently he'd forgotten that <i>she</i> had made <i>him</i> sign a pre-nup
Turns out she gets pretty much everything and he gets nothing
And then the guy's girlfriend leaves him because she thought he was rich #Laugh
Now all he has is a low paying job and a small apartment
And she's still living in her big-ass house, very much enjoying her new-found freedom
Good story, right?
[yes] Any story where the women gets out on top is a good story #Laugh
[no] Sorry #SubName, I just think that's a great story #Laugh
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Anyhow... @SetFlag(pthevLink11A)

Wait, haven't I already told you this story before?
[yes] Sorry #SubName #Laugh
[no] Oh, okay, so there was this big scene and he left her for his girlfriend @Goto(but apparently)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
There's a twist to the story though
She's now dating her husband's ex-girlfriend!
Oh, the irony #Laugh @SetFlag(pthevLink11B)
@Flag(pthevMarried) What if @ShowVar[pthevNamePartner] and I got together #Grin
@Flag(pthevGirlfriend) What if @ShowVar[pthevNamePartner] and I got together #Grin
@Flag(pthevExGF) What if @ShowVar[pthevNamePartner] and I got together #Grin
@Flag(pthevVirgin) No chance of something like that happening to you I suppose...
