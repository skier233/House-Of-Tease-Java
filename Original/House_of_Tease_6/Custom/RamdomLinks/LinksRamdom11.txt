@AllowsOrgasm(Never) Good thing I never allow you to cum, because if I did, it would not be some little orgasm where you feel nice and then its over.
@AllowsOrgasm(Rarely) Good thing I rarely allow you to cum, because if I did, it would not be some little orgasm where you feel nice and then its over.
@AllowsOrgasm(Often, Sometimes, Always) You know, if I allow you to cum today it's not going to be some little orgasm where you feel nice and then its over.
No, you wont be able to speak, or think
or do anything except feel your whole body convulsing with pleasure 
as you'll feel that orgasm surging through you over and over. 
Ah, doesn't that sound amazing? @ResponseYes(AV_YesNeutral) @ResponseNo(AV_NoNeutral)
To bad your stuck being all frustrated at the moment, huh? @ResponseYes(Ark_Frustrated)

Just a little more and you know you'll totally lose control.
The pressure builds up as you hover on the edge. 
Your thighs start to quiver. 
Your toes curling up. 
Your whole body begging for more... 
and finally you just begin slip over that edge 
and you know there's no going back. 
You feel a rush of ecstasy that becomes more and more intense
completely taking over your body.

I've been wondering have you thought about 
what it's going to feel like when you finally get the orgasm that your so desperate for?
I know how amazing it feels when so much frustration and sexual tension get released.
Just imagine that excitement growing inside you. 
The arousal building up more and more. 
Feeling your heart pounding and your breathing becoming heavy. 
Your body tensing and a wave of pleasure surging through you 
as you feel yourself getting up to the edge.

oh wow, look at you. Oh, you are so desperate aren't you? @ResponseYes(AV_desperate) @ResponseNo(AV_NoNeutral) 
You really want me to touch you that badly don't you?  @ResponseYes(AV_YesNeutral) @ResponseNo(AV_NoNeutral)
Mmm... I bet you must be so sensitive right now.
God, just imagine how good my fingers would feel against you. 
Or my lips... or maybe even my tongue..
Is this getting too much for you? @ResponseYes(AV_YesNeutral) @ResponseNo(AV_NoNeutral)
You poor thing.. 
Okay I won't keep you waiting any longer.
