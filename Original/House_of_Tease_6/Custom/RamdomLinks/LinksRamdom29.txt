I think is that you should kneel down and adore me, just like always. 
Little teased cocks don't get to cum for me. 
They just get to watch and worship. 
I love to be worshiped.
I'm making your balls fill up...you'll feel it soon enough.

Remember that everything you do brings me so much pleasure... @TempFlag(AVp006)
that denying you makes me so very, very happy... 
you give so much pleasure but you hardly have any of your own.
That's not your purpose. @ResponseYes(ThisIsMyPurposeInLife) @ResponseNo(RegretMeetingYou)
just like my little purple dildo, you're hard, 
ready

Now there's something for you to consider for a moment, #PetName.
What if your mistress got all cold and cruel? 
What if I decided you were nothing more than a toy
to be put on a shelf and only used when I felt like it? 
Would you like it?
[yes] Oh, really?
[no] No problem, #SubName @Goto(f37d9)
@DifferentAnswer #YesorNo #SubName?
My toys don't get to have own will, you know. @ApathyLevelUp
Of course, when I wanted to see you suffer @TempFlag(AVp005)
I'd find a way.
And you'd want to suffer for me. @ResponseYes(I Can Take More) @ResponseNo(DontHurtMe)
You will suffer for me not only out of desire but of necessity. @DeleteFlag(AVp005)
Oh yes, I can be a cruel mistress, you know. 
The question is, do you want me to be?
[yes] I'll put that to the test @SetFlag(AV_DommeMistress) 
[no] No problem, #SubName @Goto(f37d9)
@DifferentAnswer #YesorNo #SubName?
And more importantly, do I care what you want?

So, you're still with me, are you?  @ResponseYes(AV_YesGood) @ResponseNo(AV_NoNeutral)
I think by the end of this session, you'll be begging me to ruin your orgasm. @ResponseYes(ILikeRuiningMyOrgasm)
To deny you even more. @TempFlag(AVp004)
Because you're starting to understand how much more pleasurable it is for you to want than to have.
You're starting to understand how this relationship works.
