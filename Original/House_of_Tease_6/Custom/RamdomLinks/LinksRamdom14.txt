Cumming is followed by misery, a sense of loss, regret. 
I want you to stroke, but not cum. 
I want you to edge hard, but not release. 
I want you to be terrified of orgasming
in case that next edge is never quite as good as it could have been if you just left yourself...
blue balled, teased and denied.

You're starting to realize that there truly is no release for you.
Not physically, and not mentally. 
You're trapped in this cycle, and how do I keep you here? 
By controlling your orgasms, of course. 
You're so enamored and captivated by me because every time you pump that cock for me 
you flood your system with endorphins, dopamine, happy hormones. 
It's not cumming that you enjoy 
it's that blissful edge right before you do. 
It's that cresting that you lust after.

You love stroking "my" cock, don't you?
You love ME, don't you?  @ResponseYes(I'm in Love with You) 
Mmmhmm, give in to how good losing all of your power feels. 
There is liberty in letting go. 
Give yourself to me.

You're so used to stroking for me, but I want you to take it to the next level.
I want ownership, and you crave my control. 
So how about we pretend, just for today, that that meat between your legs, is MINE. MY cock. 
It doesn't belong to you. 
You don't control it. 
It's just a joystick, attached to your weak, vulnerable body 
which becomes more and more submissive for me with every pump of MY dick. 
feel my cock throb, feel my balls ache.
