If I say: You've been a bad boy. You say?
[yes] Saying yes or no in response to a statement like that would imply (dis)agreement.
[no] It is not your place to gauge whether or not you've been bad.	
[Nothing] This one was directed to you. Therefore you must reply.	
[sorry, I am sorry, Im sorry, apologize] That's correct. It's not your place to agree or disagree. @Goto(StartQ03Right)
@AcceptAnswer Simple accept the judgement and apologize.
