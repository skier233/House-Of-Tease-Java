If you've just received punishment, you say?
[thank you, thanks, thanking you, thankful for, thx, grateful for] That's correct. After punishment you should thank me for letting you redeem yourself. @Goto(StartQ04Right)
[sorry, I am sorry, Im sorry, apologize] If you've successfully received punishment, then you have nothing to say sorry for.	
@AcceptAnswer Punishment is meant to teach you something, reflect that in your answer.
