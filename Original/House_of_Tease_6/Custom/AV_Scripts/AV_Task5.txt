I love knowing that you're so desperate for me that even the slightest touch could set that #Cock off so your task today is  going to put that to the test. 
You're going to give 200 of the slowest, most frustrating strokes you can.  @SetVar[AV_EdgeGoal]=[5]
If you manage to reach the edge, then I know you're exactly as desperate as I want you to be and the task is complete. 
But! If you can't reach the edge, then you need to make yourself suffer and build up that ache even more for me. 
5 edges before the end of the session should do the trick #Grin @Goto(TaskReady)
