I think for your task today you should give me 3 really frustrating edges.  @SetVar[AV_EdgeGoal]=[3]
Know how you're going to do that? By stroking as light and slow as you possibly can and still get close. 
You can have as much time as you want for this task today, I'm sure you'll need it. 
These edges won't come easy, and you won't cum at all #Grin @Goto(TaskReady)
