You are really obsessed over her.
Now you will edge for her...a lot.

I could let you rest for a bit @Chance50(You Gotta Be Aching)
But I just don't fucking want to #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(You Gotta Be Aching)
I mean, you <i>gotta</i> be aching right now 
But oh yeah @RapidTextOn
That's kinda the point #Lol @Goto(Edged By Domme)

You're probably in a hurry to finish these edges, so... @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)

I wonder what's harder on you
Doing these edges for me
Or the things I do to you between each one #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Know What'd Be Funny)
#LetTheEdgeFade
You know what would be funny? @Chance50(This Would Be Funny)
If after you were done giving me these edges
I made you edge some more for me @RapidTextOn
Just because I can #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(This Would Be Funny)
This... @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)

(Direct Control)
I know I have to give up a little direct control
But I think it's kinda hot leaving the fate of your #Cock up to chance once in a while
How much pleasure you feel @RapidTextOn
How much agony you endure
All down to the roll of the die
The flip of a card
Holding your breath as your entire destiny unravels in a second @RapidTextOff
All it takes to feel a rush like that...
Is for the stakes to be high enough #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Edges Finished)
#LetTheEdgeFade 
That was the last edge you owed me #SubName
I hope you had as much fun as I did #EmoteHappy 
I think I'm ready to get back to having more direct control #Grin @Wait(20)
