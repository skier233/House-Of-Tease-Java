You're definitely having trouble keeping away from the edge #GeneralTime
What should we do about that, hm?
Maybe you just need to do more edges
Does it become easier after a while?
[yes] Hmm
[no] Hmm
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo

Just @RT(thinking about,the thought of) it @RT(makes me horny,makes me hot,turns me on) #EmoteMoan #Laugh
But let's not forget that you edged without permission here...
I have to admit, #PetName
I kind of like it when you are disobedient
Because it gives me a reason to punish you #Grin @Interrupt(pvInt_Punishment)

What should we do about that... @Interrupt(pvInt_Punishment)
