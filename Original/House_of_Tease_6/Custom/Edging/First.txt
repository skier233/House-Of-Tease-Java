C'mon #PetName, you're only supposed to edge when I say so
For example, when I say...
#Edge @EdgeNoHold
That wasn't so hard, was it?
Just try to keep away from the edge until I want you to
Or I might have to punish you...
Actually, that sounds like fun too #Laugh

You didn't have permission to edge, #Name
I guess you're enjoying yourself a little too much #EmoteWink
@CockTorture @NullResponse @CBTCock
Are you going to be able to control yourself from now on?
[yes] Good #Smile
[no] Well, you better try #PetName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
This might turn into an unpleasant session otherwise #Laugh
