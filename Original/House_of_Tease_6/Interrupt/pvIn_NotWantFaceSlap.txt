Is it a problem for you when I tell you to slap your face?
[yes] You can be such a whiny bitch sometimes, #PetName
[no] Then slap yourself in the face, right now @Goto(then slap yourself)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
But if your precious face can't take a little smack across the cheek, so be it @SetFlag(pvNoFaceSlap)
I'm sure I can find alternative ways to punish you... @Interrupt(pvIn_General)
@End
(then slap yourself)
And next time, don't hesitate or question my command @MoodDown
When I say slap your face, you will slap yourself in the damn face, #PetName
Is that understood?
[yes] Good
[no] When I say slap your face, smack either cheek with the palm of either hand
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
I don't think this is all that complicated
You think too much sometimes, #SubName
All you need to do is do whatever I tell you to do, without question @Interrupt(pvIn_General)
@End
