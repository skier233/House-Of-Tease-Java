You should be careful #Name
You never know when I might feel like playing edge roulette with you

I'll let you in on a little secret
You've been pretty good lately, so I won't make you play roulette with me

#EmoteFace Just keep it in mind though #Name
I know exactly how to make you #Ache <i>too</i> much @Chance50(Contx)

That's enough edging for now
I'll let you edge yourself into oblivion later #EmoteSmile

You were stroking without my permission after all @Chance75(42) @Interrupt(EdgeRoulette)

After all, you did ruin an orgasm
You still came <i>without</i> permission @Chance25(ERNPRno) @Interrupt(EdgeRoulette)
(ERNPRno)
#EmoteFace #Name
I think since you ruined that last orgasm you had for me
I'll spare you, <i>this</i> time #EmoteSmile @Goto(5)
(OpiateNPC)
Besides, you probably deserve roulette
#EmoteThought Maybe you deserve even worse @Chance10(NPCTerm) 
Fortunately for you
I'm having too much fun playing with you right now
Otherwise I would just deny you... <i>right now</i> @Chance20(ERNPCno) @Interrupt(EdgeRouletteNPC)

#EmoteSmile I'm feeling generous tonight though
So even though you came without my permission last time
I think I'll spare you both <i>for now</i> #EmoteHer @Goto(5)
