I would love it if you'd let me control when you masturbate @DeleteFlag(pvWantCoCo)
Not only during our sessions but in between as well @DeleteFlag(pthevCompleteControlNO)
And I would <i>love</i> it if you only cum if I say you can
So #SubName...
Do you promise to only masturbate when I say you can masturbate?
And to only cum if I say you can cum?
[yes] I think this arrangement of ours just got interesting #Grin @SetFlag(pthevCompleteControlYES)
[no] Too bad #EmoteSad @Goto(the answer is no)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
One thing though, #SubName
This only works when you are completely honest with me
I mean, I can't come over and check if you're being a good boy every day...
And and I don't what to have to ask you if you've been good every single time
So that means you should tell me whenever you've masturbated or had an orgasm without my permission
Even if it happened outside of our sessions together
Is that understood?
[yes,okay,alright,agreed,understood,understand,clear] Great #Smile
[no] #pthevCoCo-1 @LoopAnswer
[don't want,do not want,not going to,not gonna,won't,will not] Too bad #EmoteSad @DeleteFlag(pthevCompleteControlYES) @Goto(the answer is no)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
That settles it then... 
You're going to regret this, #SubName #Grin @MoodUp
@End
(the answer is no)
I thought you said you wanted that, #PetName @MoodDown @SetFlag(pthevCompleteControlNO)
But I guess you chickened out... typical
It's okay though, I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to do
