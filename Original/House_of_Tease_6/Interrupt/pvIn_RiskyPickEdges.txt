Before we start, we have some unfinished business, #Name
We played Risky Pick last time
And I happen to have written down the number of edges you owed me
You owed me @ShowVar[RP_Edges] edges
So look me in the eye #SubName, and tell me honestly
Did you do <i>all</i> of them?
[yes] You must be extra horny #GeneralTime then #Smile @Goto(did all of them)
[no] I told you to do them before you came back to me #PetName
[not all,some,few,almost,tried,most of] In other words: no, you didn't do all of them
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
It pisses me off that you can't even follow a simple instruction like that @Timeout(9,follow a simple)
[sorry,apologise,apoligize,forgive] That's not enough, #SubName
@DifferentAnswer @NullResponse
(follow a simple)
And what's the point in playing a game if you're not following the rules, anyway?
@NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom\CallReturn\pvCr_Punishment.txt)
About those @ShowVar[RP_Edges] edges you owe me...
You're going to do them right now, I don't care how long it takes
And I don't care if you did some of them or none at all
Let's get started #SubName @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Goto,need break)
(another edge)
#Edge @EdgeNoHold @ChangeVar[RP_Edges]=[RP_Edges]-[1]
@NullResponse @If[RP_Edges]<[2]Then(Edges Finished)
#pthevRPEdges
@NullResponse @Goto(another edge)
(Edges Finished)
Here comes the last one @CustomMode(#pvNeedABreak,Normal) @DeleteFlag(pthevRiskyPickOwesEdges)
#Edge @Edge 
#LetTheEdgeFade
That's all of them #Smile
Now that we've settled that score
I can actually start teasing you #Lol
@End
(did all of them)
@NullResponse  @DeleteFlag(pthevRiskyPickOwesEdges)
@NullResponse @If[RP_Edges]<[20]Then(only a few)
That means its even more fun for me to tease you 
And every edge you do #GeneralTime will be even more agonizing for you #Grin
That's exactly why we play a game like Risky Pick
@End
(only a few)
You're lucky that you only had to do @ShowVar[RP_Edges] edges
It could have been <i>much</i> worse, #PetName #Laugh 
@End
(need break)
@NullResponse @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_BreakEdging.txt)
Now where were we... still @ShowVar[RP_Edges] to go, #Name
@NullResponse @If[RP_Edges]<[2]Then(Edges Finished)
@NullResponse @Goto(another edge)
@End
