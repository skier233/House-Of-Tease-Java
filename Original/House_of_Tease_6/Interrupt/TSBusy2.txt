I'm sorry #Name, this is just bad luck
I still can't play right now, #EmoteFrowny
Soon, I promise #Name, I promise @Interrupt(TSDayReset)

I'm sorry, this is taking longer than I anticipated @ChastityOff
I might not be able to play right now
Maybe if I'm thinking about the edge I want you to ride for me though
I'll change my mind and try to hurry up
#Edge @EdgeHold
#Smile
I want you to put it back up for now
Try me again in another 30 minutes
Hopefully I'll be home then #Smile @Interrupt(TSDayReset)

I'm sorry #Name, it turns out I'm just not going to be able to play #GeneralTime
@NullResponse @Chance50(3Chaste)
But there's no reason you can't #Ache for me until tomorrow @ChastityOff
I #Want 2 edges before then #Smile
You can spend as much time stroking for those edges as you like #Smile
But after your second edge, you have to wait for me to give you permission to stroke again #Smile
(3Chaste)
Until I can play with you though
I think I just want you to #Ache for me @ChastityOn
No stroking until I give you the go ahead #Smile
Talk to you soon #Smile @Interrupt(TSDayReset)
