Is it really that hard to go without orgasms?
Are your #Balls so blue and achy that you just <i>have</i> to empty them?
I get it #Name... I really do
But I'd be very disappointed if we had to give up on this little denial experiment
All that effort gone to waste...
It would make me very unhappy
And you do want to make me happy, right?
[yes] Right, so...
[no] Oh... @Goto(do not want to make you happy)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Do you still want to cum right now?
[yes] Hmm
[no] That's a good #PetName #Laugh @Goto(if you do not want it)

You do sound pretty desperate... @GotoDommeApathy

Well #PetName I hope that was worth it
I guess we'll have to try long term denial again some other time
Maybe you're just not ready for it yet #EmoteSad
I hope you don't regret that orgasm now...
You're so much more fun to play with when you're horny and desperate #Laugh
Maybe we should start building up that ache in your #Balls right away
Do you want continue?

A ruined orgasm is an orgasm too, #Name #Grin @SetVar[pthevOrgasmLast]=[3]
You probably regret asking for an orgasm now #Lol
I just realized, this is worst outcome for both of us
I'm disappointed that you gave up, and you that you didn't get a proper orgasm
Well, never mind #EmoteWink
We should probably start building up that ache in your #Balls right away
Do you want continue?

You can stop begging for an orgasm now, #Name
I already <i>gave</i> you one, remember?
Sure, it was a <i>ruined</i> orgasm, but still... #Grin
And orgasm is an orgasm, #Name
