But since you just beat me at this game, I guess that wouldn't be very fair to me #EmoteRandom
I still owe you a few orgasms and I was looking forward to <i>making</i> you have them #Smile
That and I would much rather play Edge Roulette after I've denied you for a few days #Smile
#EmoteRandom That's what makes it fun
For now, just keep your #Hands off of #Yourself 
I know <i>better</i> ways to #Tease you #Smile

But I guess I still owe you two orgasms for winning me last time
I guess it wouldn't be fair if I beat you now and took that all away
Besides, I would much rather play Edge Roulette with you after I've denied you for a couple of days #Smile
#EmoteRandom That's what makes it fun
For now, just keep your #Hands off of #Yourself 
I know <i>better</i> ways to #Tease you #Smile

#Smile Actually, I just let you come not to long ago
<i>And</i> I still owe you an orgasm from the last time you beat me at Edge Roulette #Smile
So for now, just keep your #Hands off of #Yourself 
I know <i>better</i> ways to #Tease you #Smile
@End
(ERLoss)
But seeing as I just beat you at Edge Roulette
I don't know why I'm really considering giving you another chance to beat me #Smile
You already know what I'm going to do to you now anyway #Smile
But since I'm feeling so #Mean, I think I'll just take #That #Cock away from you instead #Smile
Just keep your #Hands off of #Yourself 
I know <i>better</i> ways to #Tease you #Smile
#EmoteRandomTF Like denying you for a few days while you think about that orgasm that I'm <i>going</i> to ruin

#EmoteRandom Then again, if I play Edge Roulette with you right now
One way or another, you still get to come and I do believe that I still owe you a denial #Smile
So, just keep your #Hands off of #Yourself 
I'll find another way to #Tease you #Name #Smile
