[her,hers] This is harder than I thought...
[your,yours] See, that wasn't too hard now was it @Goto(learning)
@DifferentAnswer Hers or mine #PetName
200 strokes for these #Boobs #PetName, go!
But NO edging!
Let me know when you're done
[done,did,finished] Okay, hands off
[yes] Let me know when you did 200 strokes @LoopAnswer
[no] Let me know when you did 200 strokes @LoopAnswer
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you did 200 strokes
So whose #Boobs are nicer, hers or mine?
[her,hers] Fuck, it's easier to train a monkey #Laugh
[your,yours] See, that wasn't too hard now was it @Goto(learning)
@DifferentAnswer Hers or mine #PetName
@NullResponse @CBTCock
300 strokes now #PetName
Remember: no edging!
[done,did,finished] Good, hands off your #Cock then
[yes] Let me know when you did 300 strokes @LoopAnswer
[no] Let me know when you did 300 strokes @LoopAnswer
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you did 300 strokes
I'll ask you one more time #SubName
Whose #Boobs do you prefer, hers or mine?
[her,hers] Oh well...
[your,yours] See, that wasn't too hard now was it @Goto(learning)
@DifferentAnswer Hers or mine #PetName
#Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
I guess you do really like those #Boobs then @Timeout(5,reallylike)
[yes,i do] I know they're nice #SubName
[no,don't] You're a puzzle wrapped in a riddle #SubName #Laugh
@AcceptAnswer It's not that they're not nice
(reallylike)
A girl just likes getting compliments that's all
I have to admit I kind of admire your tenacity #SubName
But I still feel I should punish you for being a jerk #Grin @CBTBalls
#Edge @EdgeHold

[no, don't mind, okay, no problem, fine] That's good #Smile
[don't want, please don't] It's too bad you feel that way #PetName
@AcceptAnswer Not that it matters either way

Because that's how it's going to be 
Just because I'm taking a break
Doesn't mean you should get one too
@NullResponse @AddContact1 @InterruptsOff
@Contact1 Always a pleasure to deny a boy his pleasure #Laugh
@Contact1 Oh, hi there #SubName #Grin
@Contact1 Just leave him up to me #ShortName
@Contact1 He's still stroking right?
Not at the moment, no... that'll be up to you to decide now
@Contact1 Oh okay #Laugh
Be back in a few minutes!
@Contact1 Don't hurry #Smile
@NullResponse @RemoveDomme
I'm going to tease you so bad #SubName
I love that I can access your porn from here
The stuff you keep says a lot about the kind of person you are
Like this one for example @ShowCaptionsImage @LockImages
Oh yes it tells me all I need to know #Laugh
You do have a thing for girls telling you what to do @ShowCaptionsImage @UnlockImages
Which is great cause I love telling guys what to do
I want to see how good you are #SubName
Give me 50 strokes, but don't edge!
Tell me when you're done @Timeout(20,hurry up)

Hurry up #SubName @Timeout(15,too slow)
[done,ready,did] Good boy, a little slow, but okay @Goto(more stroking)
@DifferentAnswer Tell me when you're done #SubName

Too slow, you should be done by now @CBTCock

C'mon stroke that cock faster #SubName @Timeout(15,too slow2)
[done,ready,did] You should go faster @Goto(more stroking2)
@DifferentAnswer Tell me when you're done #SubName
(too slow2)
Not good enough #SubName @CBTCock
(more stroking2)
Give me another 100 strokes, but really fast this time
And of course, no edging...
Stroke now, and don't lose count #Smile @Timeout
Tell me when you're done @Timeout(10,hurry up3)
[done,ready,did] Good boy @Goto(more stroking3)
@DifferentAnswer Tell me when you're done #SubName

[done,ready,did] It's getting harder isn't it @Goto(more stroking3)
[stop,too much,enough] Okay hands off @Goto(more stroking3)
@DifferentAnswer Tell me when you're done #SubName
(too slow3)
Stop stroking @CBTCock
That was no good #SubName
But I'll give you another chance
(more stroking3)
Do you think you could do another 100 without edging or coming?
[yes] Let's put that to the test
[no] Okay hands off then @Goto(not enough stroking)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no?
Go! @Timeout(20,hurry up4)
[done,ready,did] Wow, that was amazing! @Goto(no more stroking)
[stop,too much,enough] Okay hands off @Goto(not enough stroking)
@DifferentAnswer Tell me when you're done #SubName
(hurry up4)
I wonder if you're going to make it this time @Timeout(15,did not make it)
[done,ready,did] Good job! @Goto(no more stroking)
[stop,too much,enough] Okay hands off @Goto(not enough stroking)
@DifferentAnswer Tell me when you're done #SubName
(did not make it)
Stop stroking #SubName, I'm done waiting
(not enough stroking)
You need a little more stamina to meet my standards
But that's okay, nobody's perfect #Smile
@NullResponse @AddDomme
How are you guys doing?
@Contact1 Just testing your little subby here
And how did he do?
@Contact1 Not too good, #ShortName, not too good
#Laugh
@Contact1 It's okay though, I might have pushed him a little too far #Grin
I figured as much
Maybe next time, after some more training... @Goto(looking forward)
(no more stroking)
I'm impressed #SubName
@NullResponse @AddDomme
How are you guys doing?
@Contact1 Just testing your little subby here
And how did he do?
@Contact1 Better than I expected actually
Well jerking off is the one thing he's good at #Lol @RapidTextOn
@Flag(pthevVirgin) @Contact1 His stamina is pretty good for a virgin...
@Flag(pthevVirginEmbarrassed) Don't say that #Contact1, he's embarrassed about that
@Flag(pthevVirginEmbarrassed) @Contact1 Yeah? Maybe he ought to be...
@Flag(pthevVirginEmbarrassed) Okay that's enough #Contact1 #Laugh
I'll try to keep him in shape for your next visit @RapidTextOff

@Contact2 Hi #ShortName and #SubName what's up?
Hey there #Contact2 thanks for helping out #Smile
@Contact2 Sure, but what exactly am I supposed to do here?
@Contact2 I mean I'm supposed to tease #SubName right?
Well it's up to you I suppose, but yeah that's the general idea
@Contact2 So is he like, jerking off right now?
Nope, but he will if you tell him to #Smile
@Contact2 So you just tell him when to start and stop?
Basically, yes
He'll do anything you say, unless it's dangerous or disgusting of course
@Contact2 Why would I want to do that?? I'm not #Contact3

[terrible,awful,shit] Oh shut up #SubName it's not that bad
@AcceptAnswer I'm doing my best #SubName
#DomName told me about the porn stash on your computer
It's pretty amazing @ShowHardcoreImage @LockImages
That's fucking hot #Smile
I can't imagine masturbating to this stuff @ShowHardcoreImage
And <i>not</i> being allowed to cum
And I can't believe you let #DomName do that to you @UnlockImages
I want you to stop stroking now
Did you actually stop touching just now?
[yes] #Smile
[no] Fine, keep stroking then @Goto(keep stroking then)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no?
I have to admit though...
It's pretty hot to know you're all hard right now and not touching
I'm so wet right now :)
Good thing I've got those pictures of yours @ShowLesbianImage @LockImages
God that'a hot @Wait(12)

@Contact2 #SubName isn't exactly following orders
@Contact2 I told him to stop and he just kept going...
Come on #SubName stop stroking
#Contact2 you should punish him when he does that 
@Contact2 How?
Like this... @CBTBalls
That's enough for now #PetName
@Contact2 Oh wow, I'll... keep that in mind I guess
@Contact2 But to be honest that's more like something #Contact3 would do
Well, you have to keep your boy in line sometimes #Grin
Would you like to try it again sometime?

[hi,hello,hey] @NullResponse

@AcceptAnswer @NullResponse
(lookslike)
Looks like I've got you all to myself #SubName
You haven't stopped stroking now have you?
[yes,i have] I don't think anyone told you to, so start stroking
[no,haven't,not] Good, keep going
@DifferentAnswer Did you stop stroking, yes or no?
I think #DomName is way too easy on you
If you were my toy to play with
Let's just say 
I wouldn't be as interested in your pleasure as she seems to be
Now that we're alone I guess I could give you a little taste
Would you like that?
[yes] Of course you would, stupid question right?
[no] That's too bad, because #DomName clearly told you to do as I say
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no #SubName?
I want you to go get 9 clothespins
Hurry up, let me know when you're ready
[ready] Okay, good!
[don't have, haven't got] What kind of household do you live in that you don't have clothespins!? @Goto(NoPins)
[can't,cannot,not possible,impossible] That's disappointing #SubName @Goto(NoPins)
[don't want,please] Don't whine #SubName, go get those clothespins @LoopAnswer
[wait,hold on,need time,more time,right back] Hurry up #PetName @LoopAnswer
@DifferentAnswer Are you ready or do you need more time?
Are you still stroking? @SetFlag(pthevClothespins)
[yes] Good, keep going #Smile @Goto(stillstroking)
[no] I didn't tell you to stop #SubName
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no?
Give your #Balls one hard smack
Now give me 100 strokes as fast as you can without edging
Tell me when you're done
[100,done,did,ready,finished] Good, now keep stroking slowly
@DifferentAnswer Let me know if you're done
(stillstroking)
I want you to put 1 clothespin on each nipple @Wait(15)
Now put 3 clothespins on each of your #Balls @Wait(25)
As for that last clothespin
What should we do with that...
Stick out your tongue #SubName
I want you to put the last clothespin on your tongue @Wait(9)
Has #DomName ever done anything like this to you #SubName?
[yes] I find that hard to believe
[no] Like I said, she's going way too easy on you #Grin
@DiffentAnswer Yes or no?
She's such a sweet girl, isn't she? 
#Edge @Edge
@NullResponse @CBTCock
#DomName should let me take care of you more often
Would you like that?
[yes] Say it out loud
[no] I guess this is a little too much for you @Goto(toomuchforya)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no?
Not easy talking with that clothespin on your tongue is it
Now say: Please hurt me more #Contact3 @Timeout(8,sayitagain)
[please hurt] <i>Say</i> it, don't type it #SubName
[yes,okay,did,done,said] Good #Grin

[please hurt me more] Okay, if that's really what you want...
@DifferentAnswer Try again #SubName

OMG #Contact3 what have you done to #SubName #Laugh
Hey #SubName, do you still have that clothespin on your tongue?
[yes] #Laugh @Goto(takeoffpins)
[no] @NullResponse
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
@Contact3 What the fuck #SubName I didn't tell you to do that
Now you've done it #PetName
@Contact3 #DomName hasn't trained you well enough #SubName @CBTBalls
@Contact3 Take the clothespins off if you haven't yet @Goto(more often)
(takeoffpins)
@Contact3 Take those clothespins off now #SubName
@Contact3 you must be drooling all over yourself
Gross #Lol
@Contact3 There are so many fun things you can do with clothespins #Grin
I never knew
(more often)
You should join us more often #Contact3 I could use the help
@Contact3 And #SubName could use the training #Laugh
Well your standards are a little higher than mine...
@Contact3 Just let me know when I can join, when I've  got time I'll be there
@Contact3 For now I'll leave #SubName in your caring hands #Smile
Okay #Contact3, thanks again!

Now where were we @InterruptsOn
@End
(toomuchforya)
That's a shame, cause I'm really starting to enjoy this #SubName
There's all kinds of things I could do to you
A couple of clothespins is just the beginning @Goto(could have fun)
(NoPins)
I guess I'll have to think of some other way to torment you
First of all
Get to the edge for me @EdgeHold
Good boy :)
Do you have a leather belt?
[yes] Go get it for me!
[no] Hmmm @Goto(no belt)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no?
Do you need time to go get it?
[yes] Okay, let me know when you got it @LoopAnswer
[no] Good
[got it,have it,ready] Good
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you're ready
Put it around your neck @SetFlag(pthevLeatherBelt) @Wait(9)
Pull the end so it's good and tight
Now get on your hands and knees like a good puppy
That's where you belong #SubName
No matter how nice #DomName is to you
@NullResponse @AddDomme
Hi guys, I'm back #Smile
@Contact3 Hey, we were just talking about you
Sounds like an interesting conversation #Laugh
@Contact3 Maybe you should read back the chat by the way...
Okay...
You got #SubName in quite the predicament there #Lol 
@Flag(pthevMarried) What if @ShowVar[pthevNamePartner] walked in right now...
@Flag(pthevGirlfriend) What if @ShowVar[pthevNamePartner] walked in right now...
@Flag(pthevMarried) @Contact3 She'd freak out #Laugh
@Flag(pthevGirlfriend) @Contact3 She'd freak out #Laugh
@Flag(pthevMarried) @Contact3 Or maybe she'd just smack his ass red
@Flag(pthevGirlfriend) @Contact3 Or maybe she'd just smack his ass red
@Flag(pthevMarried) @Contact3 I guess he'll have to do it himself @Goto(smack your ass)
@Flag(pthevGirlfriend) @Contact3 I guess he'll have to do it himself @Goto(smack your ass)
@Contact3 And it's about to get much worse *grin*
(smack your ass)
@Contact3 Smack your ass for us #SubName
@Contact3 Both cheeks, left-right-left-right
@Contact3 Keep doing it and do it hard, I want your ass red
And pull on that belt around your neck, too #Grin
@Contact3 Good thing you keep #SubName on a short leash #ShortName
#Laugh
I should get you in here more often, just to keep him in line
@Contact3 You seem to be doing alright #ShortName
@Contact3 You can stop spanking yourself now #SubName @Timeout(10,what do you say)
[thank you,thanks,merci,gracias] @Contact3 You're welcome :) @Goto(better get going)
@AcceptAnswer A thank you would be nice @Goto(better get going)
(what do you say)
What do you say #PetName?
[thank you,thanks,merci,gracias] @Contact3 You're welcome :)
@DifferentAnswer No, try again...
(better get going)
@Contact3 I better get going now, thanks for letting me take over #ShortName
@Contact3 Oh and #SubName you can get off your knees now and take that belt off :)
I'm sure it won't be the last time #Contact3, talk to you later #Smile
@NullResponse @RemoveContact3
@NullResponse @Glitter(pthevGlitterMod06-05)

[yes,it was,too much] That's unfortunate #PetName
[no,okay,no problem,fine] Good #Smile
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Because I'm sure she'll be back for more sooner or later
By the way, keep that belt close, we might need it again #Grin
@NullResponse @InterruptsOn
@End
(no belt)
How about a shoelace?
[yes] Good, go get it then
[no] Another "no"... @Goto(another no)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no?
Don't take too long #SubName @Wait(10)
I think you probably know what I want you to do with it @Timeout(15,tie your balls)
[wait,hold,moment] Okay, but don't take too long @Wait(20)
[ready] Good
@AcceptAnswer @NullResponse
(tie your balls)
Loop one end around your balls and tie it with a knot @SetFlag(pthevShoelace)
Make it tight, but still comfortable
You don't want to cut your blood circulation
Oh and make sure the loose end is long enough to reach your mouth
Ready?
[yes,ready,done,did] Okay
[no,wait,moment,need more time] Let me know when you're ready
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you're ready
Now take the loose end between your teeth, so the line is tight
This way you can tug on your balls
While you've got your hands free to do other things... @CBTCock
@NullResponse @CBTBalls

Hey guys, I'm back #Smile

[yes] @Contact3 That was the idea #Laugh
[like hell,a lot,very much] Poor you #Grin
[no] You don't have to act tough #PetName
[not bad,not too bad,okay,fine,not really] @Contact3 You're tougher than I thought #SubName
@DifferentAnswer Did it hurt or not?
@Contact3 Well, I better get going now, thanks for letting me take over #ShortName
@Contact3 Oh and #SubName you can put that shoelace away now
Keep it somewhere close though, we might need it again #Grin
@Contact3 That sounds ominous #SubName #Laugh
@Contact3 talk to you later #Smile

@NullResponse @RemoveContact3
Just the two of us again #PetName
@NullResponse @InterruptsOn
@End
(another no)
Seems it's difficult to have my kind of fun with you
Give me another edge then @EdgeHold
You see, I think #DomName is going to easy on you
The way I see it, boys need to be put in their place now and then
With some pain or discomfort, nothing too extreme or dangerous of course
Don't you agree?
[yes,I agree,agreed] That's good to hear #Grin
[no,don't] You should be glad I'm not you Domme then #Smile @Goto(not your domme)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no?
But you need to be prepared for it
So you should make sure you have some items ready to use
Clothespins, a belt, shoelaces
Those are fun to play with #Grin
@NullResponse @AddDomme
Hey guys, I'm back, what's up #Smile
@Contact3 Hi #ShortName 
@Contact3 I was just making some suggestions to #SubName
@Contact3 To make things a little more... interesting
@Contact3 You know, give you more options when dealing with #SubName
More options is always good #Smile

@Contact3 Okay I gotta go #ShortName, talk to you later! @Timeout(8,talk to you later)

Do I detect a hint of disappointment?
@Contact3 Let's just say it's a good thing you're his domme not me :)
@Contact3 Anyways, maybe next time #SubName will be more cooperative
@Contact3 Gotta go now, talk to you later #ShortName :)
