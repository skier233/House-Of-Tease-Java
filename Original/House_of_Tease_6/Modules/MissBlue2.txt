To be honest, #Contact3 might be too much for you to handle #Laugh
Would you mind if they join us sometime?
[yes] That's unfortunate

@Contact1 So how turned on is he right now?
Only one way to be sure: check how fast he can edge #EmoteHappy
@Contact1 Alright, get to the edge #SubName @Edge
@Contact1 Well we did learn that he listens pretty good 
What about his turned-on-ness?
@Contact1 I'm not sure, I think I have to see that again
@Contact1 Get to the edge again #SubName @Edge
@Contact1 I think his turned-on-ness isn't quite up to my standards yet

@Contact1 At least you didn't invite #Contact3, I can't even <i>see</i> her standards

Let's do a little training exercise #PetName
(explain again)
This exercise is not about how fast you can go
But how <i>slow</i>
In a moment you're going to hear a bell
This bell @PlayAudio[PtheV\bell.mp3]
When you do, I want you to start stroking at a very slow pace
1 full stroke up and down every 5 seconds
You will count your strokes: up and down counts as one stroke
I will keep time, and at the end we'll see if you've kept pace #Smile @SetFlag(pthevMod09NoInstructions)
You have to stop stroking when you hear the bell, clear?
[yes] Good @Goto(and no cheating)
[no] It's not that hard #PetName
[how long,how much time] You'll know when the bell rings again #Smile @Goto(and no cheating)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
When you hear the bell, start stroking at 1 stroke per 5 seconds
Count your strokes
When you hear the bell again, stop stroking
Then I will ask you how many strokes you did
(and no cheating)
And no cheating by looking at the clock #SubName! @Goto(eighty,ninety,hundred)

Let's do another slow-stroking exercise

[yes] It's simple #Name
[no] I didn't think so
@AcceptAnswer It's not a difficult task
(tell me how)
Just lube it up and slide it in @Wait(9)
Is it in?
[yes,ready,done,it's in] Good @TempFlag(pthevPlugged)

I love it when you do what I say
Makes me wonder what else I could make you do
Would you do <i>anything</i> I say?
[yes, of course, absolutely, always] Oh really now #Grin @Goto(will do anything)
[no] That's good, you still have a mind of your own #Smile @Goto(mind of your own)

Okay, let me think...
If I told you to run outside naked
And kiss the ass of the first woman you see
Would you do it?
[yes] Don't be ridiculous #PetName #Lol
[no] And thank god for that #Lol
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
No woman wants some random naked guy kiss her ass

You're my little virgin aren't you?

You're not mine or not a virgin?
[not yours, don't belong] I beg to differ #PetName
[not a virgin, not virgin, had sex, both] Oh sorry I thought you were still a virgin... @Goto(thought you were)
@DifferentAnswer Either you're not mine or not a virgin, which is it?
You're still a virgin though, right?
[yes] I like that about you #SubName @Goto(i like that about you)
[no]  Oh sorry I thought you were still a virgin...

It's okay though, as long as you obey my commands #Smile

Do you feel embarrassed you that you are still a virgin?

[no] Good, it shouldn't #Smile
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
It's not a big deal, not to me at least
Though I know to some people it is, #Contact1 for example
She's my friend, but she can be a real bitch sometimes #Laugh
Somehow I feel like being a virgin makes you a better sub
More eager to please and follow instructions @Goto(being an obedient)

I wonder what real life is like for you
Like, do you obey @ShowVar[pthevNamePartner] as well as you obey me?
[yes] Good, that's the way it should be #Smile
[no] Maybe you should #SubName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
(being an obedient)
You shouldn't stop being submissive when you log off
Remember #SubName, every woman you meet is a potential domme 
The girl behind the checkout counter of the supermarket
That co-worker with the high heels
The woman at the bus stop with the long legs
Or that neighbour with the mysterious smile
@Flag(pthevSubInLove) Or @ShowVar[pthevNamePartner] for that matter...
You don't have to tell her that you want to serve her
Or kneel to kiss her feet
You can do little things
Hold the door for her
Offer to get her a drink
Be courteous
She'll appreciate the gesture
She doesn't have to know the feelings it stirs in you
But if she's a domme, she'll understand
And the glint in her eyes might tell you all you need to know #Smile

Obeying me is more important than satisfying your dirty needs
Although obeying satisfies a need as well, doesn't it #SubName?
Remember what I said about being submissive after you log off?
[yes] @NullResponse @Goto(yes I remember)
[no] Let me refresh you memory
@AcceptAnswer @NullResponse
I said that every woman or girl you meet could be a Domme
And that you can do little things the please them
(yes I remember)
Have you been putting it to practice?
[yes] Being submissive is always good #SubName #Smile
[no] Let's just say you're very loyal #PetName #Smile
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Always remember where you belong @ShowFemdomImage
I will certainly do everything I can to remind you @ShowCaptionsImage
And to reinforce what's already inside of you @ShowFemdomImage
Does it turn you on to think that way about women you meet?
[yes] I promise you many of those women feel the same way
[no] I promise you many of those women do feel that way #SubName
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Well, not all of them of course
But some will #Smile
Imagine it #SubName
Imagine one of those women, just someone you meet
Maybe she'll see your submissive nature
Maybe at night, when she's alone
She'll masturbate while picturing you kneeling before her
The smallest gesture can do that to a woman #Smile
I want you to think about that #PetName

Imagine a beautiful woman with long legs
If your imagination needs some help...
That can be arranged #Smile @ShowTaggedImage @TagLegs @LockImages
Imagine her walking down the street
The clicking of her heels on the pavement
Her hips swaying, her head held high
You might the urge to drop to your knees and worship her @UnlockImages
But that would be ridiculous #SubName
You can't go around kneeling for every woman you meet #Smile
Being submissive can mean all kinds of things though
I want you to think of small ways you can do to serve women
They don't even have to know #Smile
A dominant woman will appreciate it
And maybe a mischievous smile will tell you she understands you
Sees your submissive nature
Maybe it will even turn her on
Maybe at night, when she's alone
She'll masturbate while picturing you kneeling before her
The smallest gesture can do that to a woman #Smile
I want you to think about that #PetName
Think about the little ways in which you can serve the women in your life
