I've got a little game.
Look at you. 
You're already twitching. 
@AllowsOrgasm(Never) It must be horrible to know that you're not going to be allowed to cum today, all because you just have no control over your own cock.
Poor boy. Just a horny little boy, aren't you?
You don't have any control at all. I control your cock.
How's that cock feeling? Good?
#StartStroking
Imagine my soft, gentle, feminine fingers wrapping around it. 
Gently stroking up and down the length of your shaft, my soft skin caressing your cock up and down. 
Just slowly at first
My thumb rubbing against the tip of your cock
spreading the precum around your head.
Rubbing against that sensitive spot on the underside of your tip.
Stroking harder and harder. A little faster now.
Can you feel the blood rushing to your cock, filling it up?
It's getting harder and harder with my every word isn't it?
Oh, you poor boy. You have no chance, do you? @EdgeMode(Goto, 7fi7rf)

Party time... @AddContact1 @AddContact2 @AddContact3
See you soon #Lol @RemoveDomme
@Contact1 We're unbelievably horny. And we've got a fresh body here ready to do whatever we say.
@Contact2 Wait... what if he doesn't do what we say?
@Contact3 Easy. We punish him. 
@Contact2 You're just a body to us. You have no power, all you are is a pile of flesh.
@NotFlag(AV_LikeAnal) @NullResponse @Goto(34eh89fde)
@Contact3 Okay... I thought we were gonna fuck him.
@Contact2 Yeah, we know you are a little anal slut...
@Contact1 We known! I just wanted to... you know what? I'll explain it later. Go get your toy and some lube @Wait(40)
@Contact3 Not bad... I can get some serious work done with this.
@Contact1 I'm... surprised. Didn't think he'd have one of these there.
@Contact2 Huh. I wonder what else is around his place.
@Contact1 Yeah... I still feel a bit weird about it, but I can't really blame you.
@Contact3 Our slave here's a bit of a hoarder, huh?
@Contact2 We're calling him our slave now?
@Contact3 Why not? He deserves that treatment.
@Contact2 Whatever.
@Contact3 Alright, slave. Open that asshole of yours. Cause this cock ain't gonna fuck itself. 
@Contact2 I even let you get some lube. @Wait(35)
@Contact2 Put your legs on the table...open it @Wait(15)
@Contact2 Now let me in...
@Contact2 There we go. A nice big cock for the asshole's asshole. 
@Contact3 I'm sure you'll be feeling plenty sore after this is over.
@NotFlag(av_fetish_pain) @NullResponse @Goto(34eh89fde)
@Contact3 this is a nice position to spank your balls. 
@Contact3 Spank those balls @PlayAudio[tease\G3Spank\*.mp3] @Wait(20)
@Contact3 Did that hurt? I bet you liked it, you freak.
@Contact3 Now fuck that ass...
(34eh89fde)
@Contact1 Mmm... #DomName conditioned him nicely. 
@Contact1 #StartStroking
@Contact2 Well well, someone's having fun.
@Contact3 I am having a lot of fun with it, but I don't mind sharing.
@Contact1 I wonder how the slave's doing...
@Contact1 I can see it in his eyes. He's ~oh fuck!~ probably on the edge.
@Contact2 I want to try something new.
@Contact2 Let's see if he can edge a lot...
@Flag(AV_LikeAnal) @Contact2 while fucking his ass...
@Contact2 without cumming
@Contact2 At the beginning, you'll have enough time to recover, but it's getting shorter and shorter.
@Contact2 At the end you'll have about 5 seconds to rest.
@Contact2 It's going to be very frequently. Much more than you had before.
@Flag(AV_LikeAnal) @Contact3 Remember, you fuck your ass only when you stroke
@Contact2 Let's begin. I'll give you as a lot time for the first ones.
@Contact2 #Edge @EdgeNoHold
@Contact2 Good boy.
@Contact2 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(2, 20, 100)
@Contact2 You see, we are starting very slow this time..
@Contact2 But don't worry, it's getting faster very soon.
@Contact1 Let me try
@Contact1 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges(3, 18, 100)
@Contact1 I love these frequent edges.. --------- 6 -----------
@Contact3 There's nothing more intense than that.
@Contact3 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges( #Random(2, 3), 15, 100)
@Contact3 Can you feel the frustration?
@Contact2 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges( #Random(2, 3), 12, 100)
@Contact2 Good boy. You deserved a short rest.
@Contact2 But don't think we are finish.
@Contact1 No, no.
@Contact1 You have to do more.
@Contact1 Alright,
@Contact1 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges( #Random(2, 3), 10, 100)
@Contact1 You're so good..
@Contact1 You love it!
@Contact3 We're not done..
@Contact3 #Edge @EdgeNoHold @MultipleEdges( #Random(2, 3), 5, 100)
@Contact3 You're all worked up over some STUPID little thing. 
@Contact3 No, I know that look. 
@Contact3 Soon you're going to start... start.. no no stop. right here. 
@Contact3 I know that you want to be mad.. but I just don't have time for that right now. 
@Contact2 You don't even mind when we are rude like that. 
@Contact2 In fact.. as long as we don't stop groping at your hard cock.. 
@Contact2 I'll bet you will put up with we, no matter how much of a mean little cunt we're being? 
@Contact1 Mmm let's put that to the test, shall we?  
@Contact3 Get on your knees, #Slave!
@Flag(AV_LikeAnal) @Contact3 You don't need to fuck your ass, but keep it full...
@Contact3 Trust me, you won't enjoy my torment.
@Contact3 Now you will suffer!
@Contact3 Crab that cock and stroke it! @PlayAudio[tease\cStroke.mp3]
@Contact1 Stroke it faster!
@Contact2 You shouldn't enjoy that.
@Contact2 I've heard, you like it to hit the edge..
@Contact1 You like that moment, you're quite before releasing your desperate cock.
@Contact3 Oh boy. I will let you edge.
@Contact3 I will let you edge so damn hard!
@Contact2 Stroke it faster!
@Contact3 Harder!
@Contact3 Don't you dare edge before I say you can!
@Contact3 I won't just let you edge.
@Contact3 No, I will let you ride the edges.
@Contact3 Your cock will be so swollen, when I'm done with you.
@Contact1 Are you already near the edge?
@Contact1 Not yet #Slave
@Contact3 I tell you, when you can.
@Contact3 First you have to suffer for me.
@Contact3 Jerk it..
@Contact2 Stroke, stroke, stroke. 
@Contact3 Now get on the edge, #Slave! @EdgeHold @PlayAudio[tease\cEdge.mp3]
@Contact1 You look a bit exhausted.
@Contact2 Maybe we should take a short break.
@Contact3 Nope
@Contact2 Get back on the edge now! @EdgeHold @PlayAudio[tease\cEdge.mp3]
@Contact1 No cumming..
@Contact3 I would never let him cum.

@Contact3 You will learn to love being denied.
@Contact3 'Cause being denied is suffering for me.
@Contact3 And you suffering makes me happy.
@Contact1 Stay on that edge, #Slave.
@Contact1 I don't think you're suffering enough. @EdgeMode(Normal)
@Contact2 You could always suffer more for me.
@Contact3 #StopStroking
@Contact3 You think I have enough?
@Contact2 Oh no. not at all.
@Contact2 Get back on the edge! @EdgeHold @PlayAudio[tease\cEdge.mp3]
@Contact1 We have enough of you now
@Flag(AV_LikeAnal) @Contact2 You can sit, remove the plug and clean yourself @Wait(45)
