I feel like playing a game of Risky Pick @If[#BronzeTokens]<[100]Then(Not Enough Tokens)
You up for it?
[yes] Awesome #EmoteHappy
[no] Oh well @Goto(No Thanks)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no #PetName?
First things first, gotta pay to play #Grin @RapidTextOn

Maybe you'll feel a little more adventurous next time #Grin
@End

But you don't have enough tokens to play #EmoteFlustered
Better hit up that slot machine #PetName
But not right now
I have other plans in store for you #Grin

I bet those edges from our Risky Pick game aren't doing you any favors @Chance50(Screw It)
But honestly
If it didn't make your #Cock ache like crazy
It wouldn't be of any interest to me in t he first place #Grin

Screw it @RapidTextOn
Let's add another one right now #Grin

I want to play a little game with you #PetName
I call it Avoid The Edge #EmoteHappy
The rules are pretty simple really
I'm going to pick one of your porn videos for you to watch
And you have to stroke the entire time it's playing
The thing is though...
I don't want you to edge, I only want you to stroke
But if you can't help yourself, and you <i>do</i> get close, just tell me
And I'll pause the video while I cool you down a little
And just for the record
That may not be as pleasant as it sounds #Grin
All you have to do to win is make it through the whole video
And don't worry about losing
I'll make sure you won't #Lol
So now that you know the rules @SetFlag(NoAvoidTheEdgeInstructions)
Let's play #Grin @PlayAvoidTheEdge
You made it!
Pretty fun game, right?
[yes] I'm glad you think so #PetName
[was fun] I'm glad you think so #PetName
[no] That's kind of a shame #PetName
[wasn't fun, wasn't, not fun, was not fun] That's kind of a shame #PetName
@DifferentAnswer C'mon #PetName, yes or no?
Cause we'll be playing a lot more of that, I'm sure #Grin
But for now
I have something else in mind
@End

I want to play Avoid The Edge with you again
Up for it? #EmoteHappy
[yes] I was hoping you'd say that #Grin
[no] That's okay #PetName @Goto(That's Okay)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no #PetName?
Let's get started @PlayAvoidTheEdge
You made it!
That was fun #EmoteHappy
Next time I'll find an even better video for you to stroke to #Grin
@End
(That's Okay)
I have plenty of other ways to make you squirm #Grin

the edges that I had you endure for my pleasure
I love it when you're primal and desperate for me.
I'm going to #Play with you.
